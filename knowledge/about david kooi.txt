Here is David Kooi's LinkedIn Description:

With a passion for nature, science, the wonders of music, and the transformative potential of cannabis, I've dedicated my professional journey to exploring their wonders and their intersections. 

My work with Jointly goes beyond offering a cannabis discovery platform, it's about shedding light on the benefits of purposeful cannabis consumption, underpinned by data. I'm grateful for the opportunity to introduce Jointly’s AI and data-driven tools for consumers, budtenders, and retailers, and for the chance to author the Theory of Purposeful Cannabis Consumption.

Before diving into the world of cannabis, I founded the Santa Monica Mountains Cyclery, where I blended my past professional experience with my genuine love for cycling and endurance sports. The shop became a testament to community, service, and the joy of cycling. Thanks to the team's collective efforts, our local shop earned a reputation as one of southern California's best bicycle retailers, brick & mortar and e-commerce - a journey that culminated in a sale to Trek.

Additionally, my time spent building and scaling complex operations at companies like McMaster-Carr and Navistar, and developing groundbreaking e-commerce software with Click Commerce, instilled in me a profound respect for data and its power to drive improvement and innovation.

Through Skylark Creations, a personal initiative, I've consulted with a variety of businesses, mostly in the areas of strategy and operations. Alongside this, I've dabbled in a range of writing endeavors, from political speeches to song lyrics.

An aspiring cultivator of the Dao and a perpetual student, I enjoy engaging with the natural world and continuously learning. I meditate for hours each day, but don’t consider myself great at it. And there I go judging again. If you can’t reach me, I’ll be in the mountains. Also, we just bought a microscope. Importantly, my life often is accompanied by bluegrass, reggae, folk, or jamgrass music.

My current favorite subjects are: microscopy, Colorado wildflowers, mycology, ornithology, geology, and the early human history of the Rocky Mountains.
