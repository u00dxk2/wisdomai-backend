Light, Life, and Cannabis[a]
“Who sends the light?” I asked myself one day, staring up at the sky like some cosmic detective who forgot their notepad. It’s not a bad question, really, if you’re in the mood for those kinds of things. I looked around at all the stuff - the trees, the soil, the bugs, the whole earthy wonder - and thought, “Wait, who sends the stuff?” But we know the answer to this: the light and the stuff are the same thing. They’re just playing different roles in the same weird, energetic play.
Every living thing on this planet, from the algae in your fish tank to the thoughts you’re having right now, is basically light wearing a very complicated costume. Plants turn sunlight into food. We eat plants, or things that eat plants, and somehow turn that into nervous systems capable of scrolling Instagram and arguing about politics. It’s the electricity within us that makes us tick. Keeps us alive. Conscious. When that electricity is gone, we no longer inhibit the body. This is true for all living things. Hold electrodes up to a plant and you’ll observe the same thing. It’s absurd, but also kind of beautiful.
So, if we’re all just light rearranged into people and plants and meerkats, why are we so bad at getting along? Why so much judgment, conflict, and acrimony? You’d think the fact that we’re all just bursts of stardust would inspire a little more camaraderie, but nope. Humans gotta human, I guess. Although we’re not unique this way in the animal kingdom so it has to be a feature not a bug.
This isn’t a new question. People have been losing sleep over this since they figured out how to write it down. Philosophers, mystics, and probably some very stoned shepherds have all tried to untangle it. The question of evil. But maybe the answer isn’t about fixing the conflict at all. Maybe the light needs the shadow. Maybe the fight is part of the deal.
Life as Duality: Light, Shadow, and the Spectrum of Existence
Here’s the thing about the universe: it loves balance. To have light, you need shadow. To have creation, you need destruction. To have good, you need evil - or at least something that keeps good on its toes. It’s like the whole cosmos runs on a kind of cosmic tension, like a rubber band stretched just enough to keep the whole thing from falling apart. (although that’s a different kind of energy than light).
Life is no different. Plants take sunlight and turn it into food. Animals take that food and turn it into action. And humans? We take all of it - light, food, action - and somehow turn it into arguments on the internet. But even that chaos fits into the pattern. Duality isn’t some flaw in the system; it’s the system. Every up needs a down. Every inhale needs an exhale. That’s just how the math works.
But here’s where it gets even more interesting: the energy that powers life of course isn’t limited to sunlight. Deep beneath the surface, the Earth itself pulses with energy - geothermal heat left over from its fiery beginnings and the radioactive decay of ancient atoms. The creatures thriving around hydrothermal vents at the bottom of the ocean don’t owe the sun a thing. They exist because the Earth has its own energy to give.
And yet, the energy of the sun and the energy of the Earth share a common ancestor. Both trace their origins back to the same cosmic explosion, the same star-forming dust that birthed the planets and ignited the sun. In that sense, all energy on Earth - whether solar or geothermal - is part of the same family tree. Life is just the universe’s way of dancing with whatever energy it can find, turning it into something miraculous, fleeting, and full of possibility. A cooperation between energy and matter to produce consciousness. To look back at itself. 
It’s no wonder there are so many sun gods. 
The Taoists had this figured out ages ago. They didn’t try to banish the shadow or pick a side. They just said, “Yeah, it’s all part of the deal.” That quote isn’t from Lao Tzu. They called it yin and yang: two forces constantly pushing and pulling, always in balance, even when it doesn’t look like it. What looks like chaos to us might just be the universe doing its thing - staying balanced in ways we’re too close to see.
So where does that leave you, sitting here, reading this, trying to make sense of why life feels like one long tug-of-war? Maybe it means you’re not supposed to untangle it all. Maybe your job isn’t to pick a side in the cosmic boxing match but to see it for what it is: a messy, beautiful balance[b]. And maybe, just maybe, that friction - between light and shadow, good and evil, you and the guy who cuts you off in traffic - is the whole point. Without it, we’d all just be light with nothing to shine on.
Human Conflict: A Reflection of Cosmic Wrestling
We humans like to think we’re above all this duality stuff, but the truth is, we’re right in the thick of it. In fact, we might be its most dramatic example. Every one of us is a little bundle of light and shadow, fighting it out internally, and projecting that fight onto everyone else. It’s no wonder we’re so good at judgment, conflict, and generally making a mess of things.
Here’s the wild part: everyone thinks they’re the good guy. Even the worst people you can imagine - yes, even that guy - believe they’re doing the right thing. Their understanding of the light, of themselves, of the universe, is just... warped. Twisted up by fear, ego, trauma, or some combination of the above. But from their perspective? They’re the hero. They’re saving the day.
This doesn’t mean we have to condone bad behavior or pretend harm doesn’t exist. It just means we have to see it for what it is: another reflection of the same cosmic wrestling match that creates light and shadow, good and evil, stars and supernovas. Maybe our conflicts aren’t some cosmic mistake but a byproduct of the universe trying to figure itself out. If we’re all just the universe observing itself, then maybe these fights are like growing pains - necessary, if not exactly fun.
But here’s where it gets tricky: we can’t just sit back and let conflict run wild, assuming it’ll all balance out in the end. We’ve got to engage with it in a way that adds more light than shadow. That doesn’t mean fixing everyone or solving every problem. It means stepping out of judgment and into understanding. Easier said than done, sure - but isn’t that what we’re here to practice?
Cannabis as a Bridge: Dissolving Ego, Embracing Unity
And then there’s cannabis. This humble plant, powered by the same sunlight as everything else, somehow holds a key to the whole thing - or at least a way to glimpse it. Cannabis doesn’t give you answers. It’s not that kind of teacher. What it does, though, is dissolve the walls you’ve built around your ego, the ones that convince you you’re separate from the world, from other people, from the light itself.
When I consume cannabis purposefully - when I slow down and let it work - it’s like the veil lifts. I’m reminded that all the stuff I thought was “me” is really just light wearing my face for a while. The barriers that make it easy to judge, to hold grudges, to feel apart from the flow of life - they start to fade. What’s left is a sense of connection, not just to other people but to the plants, the Earth, and the strange, chaotic beauty of it all.
Cannabis doesn’t fix the duality, of course. It doesn’t erase the light and the shadow or solve all the conflicts in the world. But it lets you step outside the fight for a moment and see it for what it is. It reminds you that the person you’re arguing with is just another little burst of stardust, wrestling with their own shadows. It’s humbling and liberating all at once.[c]
And here’s the kicker: cannabis itself is part of this cosmic dance[d]. It’s a plant - a living thing shaped by sunlight - interacting with us, another kind of living thing. It’s as if the universe, in all its cleverness, found a way to help us remember what we are. A reminder, in the form of a leaf and a flower, that we’re all connected, all part of the same flow of energy that’s been shining since the stars first lit up.
Closing: An Invitation to Wonder and Purposeful Reflection
So here we are, back where we started: the light and the stuff. You, me, the plants outside your window, the conflicts that keep us up at night - it’s all the same energy, just playing different roles. The universe observing itself. Wrestling with itself. Trying to figure out what it means to be alive.
Cannabis, if you let it, can be a guide through all this. It’s not a solution or an escape - it’s a bridge. A way to step out of the noise and reconnect with the light that flows through everything. The next time you consume, don’t just let it be another moment of distraction. Sit with it. Let it remind you that you’re stardust, powered by sunlight, sharing this fleeting, miraculous existence with every other living thing.
And maybe, if you’re lucky, it’ll help you ask a better question - not “Why is there conflict?” or “What’s the meaning of it all?” but something simpler, something the universe itself might ask: “What will you do with your moment in the light?”[e]


[a]love it. (the whole piece).
[b]you could even call it a dance.
[c]It is interesting that whenever cannabis pulls my ego and attitude down a notch, these are the exact words that describe the feeling: humbling and liberating.
[d]oh there's the dance!
[e]dance.
