An AI Who Helps You Get a Better High
With (slowly) increasing legalization and growing societal acceptance, cannabis is no longer a taboo subject relegated to whispers and stereotypes. Yet, despite this progress, cannabis remains widely misunderstood and vastly underutilized. Its potential to improve lives is immense, but for many consumers, the journey to unlocking that potential is riddled with uncertainty and inconsistency.
Cannabis is not your typical consumer product. It’s a complex plant, producing a variety of effects depending on its cannabinoids, terpenes, and other compounds. People use it for at least 12 distinct purposes, from relaxation to creativity, pain relief to improved sleep. What makes it even more unique is its variability: the same product can affect two people very differently, depending on factors like physiology, dosage, and setting.
Achieving consistent success with cannabis requires more than just choosing the right product - it demands creating the right conditions for a good experience. This involves considering factors like tolerance, hydration, diet, exercise, and environment. Unfortunately, most consumers lack access to reliable guidance that ties all these variables together.
At Jointly, we’ve spent the past several years helping cannabis users bridge this gap. Since 2020, our app has empowered hundreds of thousands of people to practice purposeful consumption. By reflecting on their cannabis experiences - tracking their goals, what works, what doesn’t, and the factors that impact outcomes - users have unlocked the full potential of cannabis to improve their lives.
The results speak for themselves. On average, new Jointly users rate their initial cannabis experience at 6.5 out of 10 - a number that reflects both the plant’s promise and its pitfalls. Through purposeful consumption, users increase the quality and effectiveness of their experiences by an average of 50%. This isn’t just about finding the right strain or product, which accounts for only 25% of the cannabis experience. The other 25% is dose, and a staggering 50% comes down to those external factors: set, setting, and lifestyle.
It’s this understanding that has driven Jointly to innovate further, leveraging millions of data points contributed by our users to create something revolutionary: Jointly’s AI, now available in the Jointly mobile app.
Jointly’s AI is like having the world’s most knowledgeable budtender in your pocket - for free. It’s a revolutionary step forward, combining the insights of thousands of purposeful cannabis users with cutting-edge AI technology to provide goal-specific product performance data and personalized consumption best practices. Whether you’re new to cannabis or a seasoned enthusiast, Jointly’s AI can help you create the conditions for a 10 out of 10 experience every time.
In a world where AI headlines often provoke existential dread - discussions about robots taking jobs, AI-driven misinformation, or even hypothetical zoos for humans - Jointly’s AI is a refreshing reminder that technology can also make life better. Before AI takes over and locks us behind glass, why not let it help us enjoy cannabis more?
This isn’t the first AI-powered assistant in cannabis, but it’s the most advanced. Earlier entrants in the space relied on basic machine learning and rudimentary technologies that fell short of the complexity needed to truly enhance the cannabis experience. Today, even major cannabis e-commerce players are jumping into AI, integrating personalization features into their platforms. But the true value for consumers will come from companies like Jointly - those with the deep, meaningful data needed to layer on top of the advancing frontier models.
Good budtenders and dispensaries are invaluable, but their reach is inherently limited. Jointly’s AI expands on this by offering 24/7 personalized, data-driven guidance wherever and whenever it’s needed. It’s not just about making better product choices; it’s about transforming the entire cannabis journey into a more intentional, effective, and enjoyable experience.
Cannabis, consumed purposefully, improves lives. With Jointly’s AI, you’re never alone on that journey. It’s time to move beyond trial and error and embrace a new era of personalized, informed, and transformative cannabis use. Let’s get you the high you deserve - and maybe even a little hope for what AI can do for us along the way.
