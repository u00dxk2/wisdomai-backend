Cannabis: An Experience Good in a Search Good World
When I talk to people about cannabis, I often begin with a simple question: 
What made your most recent cannabis experience meaningful? 
The answers are as varied as the people themselves. Some mention the joy of unwinding after a stressful week. Others describe a moment of creativity unlocked, a deeper connection with friends, a walk in nature, enjoyable play with their children, or even a better night’s sleep. What’s striking, though, is that none of these answers are about THC percentages or strain names. They’re about the experience.
Yet for most of its history, the cannabis industry has treated cannabis as if it were a search good, not an experience good. For the uninitiated, economists use these terms to describe two distinct types of consumer products.
A search good is something you can evaluate before purchasing - like a pair of socks or a new laptop. You can look at the specs, compare prices, read reviews, and, with enough diligence, predict whether the product will meet your needs.
An experience good, by contrast, is something you can only evaluate after you’ve used it - like dining at a restaurant, watching a movie, or, yes, consuming cannabis.
Cannabis, by its very nature, is an experience good. Its value isn’t in the strain name, the percentage of cannabinoids, or the packaging - it’s in the effect it has on you, your mindset, and your life.
But here’s the unfortunate truth: the cannabis industry has largely operated as if cannabis were a search good. This fundamental misalignment has stifled both the industry’s growth and its potential to truly transform lives.
The Problem with Treating Cannabis as a Search Good
When cannabis is treated as a search good, the focus shifts to quantifiable metrics: THC percentages, strain names, and price per gram. Dispensary menus are often organized like spreadsheets, prioritizing what’s measurable over what’s meaningful. Marketing campaigns emphasize high THC or low prices as a proxy for “better cannabis,” and consumers, understandably, follow the cues they’re given.
The result is an industry built on oversimplified assumptions about what people want. High-THC products dominate shelves, even though most people aren’t chasing the most intense high - they’re chasing a specific experience.
It’s like the wine industry deciding that higher alcohol content is the only thing that matters, ignoring terroir, flavor profiles, and pairing possibilities. Interestingly, have you noticed that the wine industry doesn’t mention terpenes - despite the fact that terpenes are in wine? Maybe that’s a lesson for us.
This search-good mindset creates friction for consumers. Imagine a first-time cannabis user trying to navigate a dispensary. They’re bombarded with jargon, overwhelmed by options, and left with little guidance on how to find the right product for their unique needs. It’s no surprise that some walk away frustrated, feeling like cannabis didn’t deliver what they hoped.
And this approach isn’t just failing consumers - it’s failing the industry. When cannabis is reduced to a commodity, it becomes a race to the bottom on price and THC percentage. Brands struggle to differentiate themselves, margins shrink, and the promise of cannabis as a life-enhancing tool gets lost in the noise.
The Role of Credence in Cannabis
It’s also worth considering another category: credence goods. A credence good is a product whose quality or value is difficult - if not impossible - for the consumer to evaluate, even after purchase or use. Credence goods rely heavily on trust, expertise, and external validation.
Examples of credence goods include healthcare services, organic food, or nutritional supplements. You might believe a multivitamin is improving your health or that a particular car repair was necessary, but in many cases, you lack the expertise or tools to verify those claims. You rely on certifications, reputation, and the expertise of others to inform your choice.
There are credence aspects to cannabis, especially when it comes to claims about safety, purity, and health benefits. For example:
* Is the product truly free of harmful pesticides or contaminants?
* Were the cannabinoids and terpenes extracted in a way that preserves quality?
* Does the product actually contain the cannabinoids and terpenes listed on the label?
These are questions that most consumers cannot answer for themselves. Instead, they must rely on third-party lab testing, product certifications, and the integrity of brands and retailers.
While these credence aspects are important, we must be cautious about leaning too heavily into cannabis as a credence good. Why? Because the more cannabis becomes about certifications and lab results, the less it emphasizes the personal, subjective, and experiential nature of its value.
If we define cannabis primarily as a credence good, we risk reducing it to a checklist of claims rather than embracing it as a tool for enhancing people’s lives. That’s why it’s critical to balance these aspects - ensuring consumers can trust the safety and quality of the product while making sure the conversation always comes back to experience.
What Happens When We Treat Cannabis as an Experience Good
Imagine if the cannabis industry shifted its perspective and treated cannabis for what it truly is: an experience good. What would change? Almost everything.
First, we’d start with education. Instead of focusing solely on THC and CBD percentages, we’d help consumers understand how cannabis interacts with their individual biochemistry, mood, and intentions. We’d guide people to ask better questions, like: What kind of experience are you seeking? Are you looking to enhance creativity, deepen relaxation, or improve your sleep?
Second, we’d reimagine the dispensary experience. Instead of sterile menus that read like a list of search results, we’d design them to be intuitive, experiential, and personalized. Recommendations would be based on mood, activities, or goals - not just cannabinoid content. Technology could play a major role here, with AI-powered tools helping consumers make smarter, data-informed choices based on their preferences and past experiences.
Third, we’d rethink how we measure value. Instead of treating high THC as the gold standard, we’d shift the focus to outcome-based success. Did the consumer achieve the experience they were seeking? If so, that’s the win - not whether they got the “strongest” product.
This approach wouldn’t just benefit consumers - it would transform the industry. When brands prioritize the consumer experience, they open the door to real differentiation. Instead of competing on price or potency, they compete on trust, quality, and their ability to deliver meaningful results. This builds loyalty and drives repeat business - the holy grail for any consumer-facing industry.
Why It Matters
At its best, cannabis is deeply personal and profoundly transformative. It’s a tool that can enhance your life in ways both subtle and profound. But for that promise to be realized, we need to stop treating it like a widget and start treating it like what it is: an experience.
This shift is about fulfilling the true potential of cannabis. It’s about helping people connect with themselves and others in more purposeful ways. It’s about reframing cannabis not as an intoxicant, but as a wellness tool - a way to be more present, more creative, more you.
“You + Cannabis > You” isn’t just a tagline - it’s a truth we should all embrace. But it’s a truth that can only be realized when we align our industry practices with the reality of what cannabis is.
By treating cannabis as an experience good, we not only improve the consumer journey - we elevate the entire industry. We unlock cannabis’s ability to transform lives, and we give people the tools to embrace its full potential.
It’s time to leave the search-good mindset behind and step into a future where cannabis is valued for what it truly is: a bridge to better experiences, deeper understanding, and a better version of ourselves.
