Habitual vs Intentional vs Purposeful Cannabis Consumption
Different approaches

DAVID KOOI

As an advocate for the transformative potential of cannabis, I’ve always emphasized the importance of purposeful cannabis consumption. A common question I encounter is about the difference between “intentional” and “purposeful” consumption, and I believe it's equally important to understand how these differ from “habitual” consumption.

Before we dive in, I want to emphasize that there is no universally 'right' or 'wrong' way to consume cannabis. The diversity in consumption methods and practices reflects the individuality of consumers and their unique needs. If someone is using cannabis in a way that enhances their life and brings them benefits, then more power to them. The key is that the use of cannabis should contribute positively to one's life, whether it aligns with purposeful, intentional, or habitual consumption patterns. 

Habitual Consumption

Definition: Habitual consumption refers to the regular use of cannabis as part of a routine, often lacking a conscious reason or specific intent for each use. This automatic nature means consumption becomes a part of one's daily or regular habits.

Focus: The focus here is often on the act of consuming as part of a routine. Unlike the deliberate mindfulness of intentional consumption or the goal-oriented approach of purposeful consumption, habitual consumption emphasizes comfort and familiarity of routine rather than specific outcomes or reasons.

Scope: Habitual consumption might mean using cannabis as part of a daily routine, without actively considering the reasons for each use or the outcomes it produces. This type lacks the element of conscious choice central to both intentional and purposeful consumption.

Intentional Consumption

Intentional cannabis consumption is a fundamental component of a purposeful approach. It signifies a basic level of conscious decision-making in using cannabis, whether for relaxation, pain relief, or other reasons. Intentional use is a crucial first step in a journey towards a more informed and effective cannabis experience. It represents the user's choice to consume cannabis with a specific goal in mind. 

Definition: Intentional consumption is the act of consuming cannabis with a clear and conscious reason, where every action is deliberate and stems from a specific intent. 

Focus: The emphasis is on the conscious choice behind the consumption. It's about being aware of what you're consuming and why.

Scope: Intentional consumption means using cannabis with a clear understanding of the reasons for its use.

Purposeful Consumption

Purposeful cannabis consumption, as defined in the Theory of Purposeful Cannabis Consumption, is a more sophisticated model and framework. It incorporates intentional use but adds layers of experimentation and reflection, creating a cycle of continuous learning and improvement. This approach involves not just choosing cannabis with a purpose but also understanding the myriad of factors that influence its effectiveness. It's about selecting the right product, dosage, and consumption method, considering the individual’s physiology, and being mindful of the context in which cannabis is used.

Experimentation and reflection are central to this approach. Purposeful consumption encourages users to try different products and methods, reflecting on each experience to understand what works best for them. This process is supported by data and evidence, making it the most reliable path to finding the most effective cannabis solutions for individual needs.

Purposeful consumption is a concept that has evolved significantly over the years, incorporating elements of intentional use but transcending them to reach a more nuanced and effective approach. 

Definition: Purposeful consumption involves consuming cannabis with a defined goal or purpose in mind, directed towards achieving a specific outcome or benefit.

Focus: The emphasis is on the desired outcome or benefit of the consumption. It's about aligning the act of consuming cannabis with a particular goal or set of goals.

Scope: Purposeful consumption means using cannabis to achieve specific goals or benefits, like better sleep, reduced anxiety, or increased creativity. 

At Jointly, we facilitate this process through our platform, harnessing the power of user-generated data. Our users share their experiences, providing insights into how various cannabis products perform for specific goals. This data forms the backbone of our purposeful consumption model, offering a real-world, evidence-based guide to cannabis consumption.

The role of Spark AI is becoming pivotal. As an AI tool developed by Jointly, it leverages our extensive database to provide personalized recommendations to users, analyzing data from hundreds of thousands of user experiences.

Our goal at Jointly is to support and empower each individual's journey with cannabis, celebrating the positive impact it can have in various forms.

The journey from habitual to intentional to purposeful cannabis consumption is an evolution from a basic understanding of cannabis's potential to a sophisticated, data-informed approach. It’s a journey that Jointly is proud to facilitate, through our commitment to data, innovation, and the empowering potential of cannabis. Purposeful consumption, underpinned by experimentation, reflection, and intelligent use of technology like Spark AI, represents the future of cannabis use – a future where cannabis is not just used but used well, with profound benefits for individuals and society as a whole.
