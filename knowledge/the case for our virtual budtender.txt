The Case for Our Virtual Budtender
Imagining the Near Future
Think about what ChatGPT can already do. 

Now, imagine whatever comes next.
Artificial intelligence is reshaping industries and redefining the way businesses engage with their customers. This technology is about creating experiences that feel intuitive, personal, and impactful. In every industry, leaders are asking how they can harness the power of AI to transform customer interactions.
What if your cannabis dispensary could harness a similar power - but upgraded and purpose-built for cannabis retail? 
Imagine an AI assistant on your website, one that not only understands cannabis but also knows your dispensary: your inventory, your voice, your policies. A tool designed not just to answer questions but to actively help your customers find the perfect product for their needs, boosting sales and satisfaction in the process.
This is no longer a futuristic idea. 
With Jointly’s Virtual Budtender, it’s the reality of today.
What the Virtual Budtender Can Do
The Virtual Budtender is like having your best budtender online 24/7 - ready to assist, educate, and guide your customers through their cannabis shopping journey. It’s not just software; it’s a powerful tool tailored to your dispensary’s unique needs.
Here’s how it works:
* Knows Jointly’s extensive data on cannabis product performance and consumption best practices: Backed by millions of real consumer experiences and medically reviewed content, the Virtual Budtender provides recommendations that are scientifically informed and goal-specific.
* Customizable to reflect your dispensary’s inventory, voice, and policies: It doesn’t just match products to consumer needs - it does so while speaking in your brand’s language, aligning with your unique store identity.
* Provides personalized, data-backed recommendations: Whether it’s helping customers find a relaxing edible or a sleep-inducing tincture, the Virtual Budtender delivers suggestions designed to meet their goals.
* Integrates seamlessly into your website: It’s an always-on assistant that helps customers make confident purchasing decisions, reducing frustration and boosting trust.
The Results Speak for Themselves:
* Boosting online conversions: Customers get the confidence they need to complete their purchases, reducing cart abandonment.
* Enhancing customer satisfaction and loyalty: By helping customers find products that actually work for their goals, the Virtual Budtender keeps them coming back.
* Saving you money: Fewer calls and emails to your staff mean more time for them to focus on in-store customers and operations.
It’s like bringing the expertise and personal touch of your best in-store budtender into your online storefront, ensuring your customers are cared for no matter where they shop.
Why This Matters Now
Consumers expect more from their shopping experiences, and retailers face mounting pressure to deliver seamless, personalized service both in-store and online. Personalized e-commerce isn’t just an option anymore - it’s a necessity, and the stakes are high.
E-commerce Trends in Cannabis:
* Increased demand for seamless, interactive online shopping: Customers are used to intuitive digital experiences in other industries and expect the same from cannabis retailers.
* Convergence on personalization: Shoppers don’t just want to browse; they want tailored recommendations that meet their unique needs and goals.
* The importance of standing out: In a crowded marketplace, differentiation is key to retaining customers and growing revenue.
The Challenges Dispensaries Face:
* Limited capacity for personalized online recommendations: While in-store budtenders can provide tailored guidance, online shoppers often have to navigate product choices alone, leading to frustration and indecision.
* High cart abandonment rates: Without expert advice, many customers abandon their carts, unsure if they’ve made the right selection.
* The missing online budtender: In-store, your staff helps customers feel confident and cared for. But online? Most dispensaries lack the tools to recreate that experience.
Jointly’s Virtual Budtender offers customers the personalized guidance they crave and ensures that your online presence is just as impactful as your in-store experience. With this tool, you’re not just keeping up with trends - you’re setting the standard.
The Power Behind the Virtual Budtender
What makes the Virtual Budtender revolutionary isn’t just the technology - it’s the intelligence and insight driving every recommendation. At its core is Jointly’s unmatched data ecosystem, built from real-world experiences and refined for accuracy and trust.
Data-Driven Technology:
* Powered by millions of data points: Since 2020, hundreds of thousands of cannabis consumers have shared their experiences through the Jointly app, creating the only comprehensive database of cannabis product performance.
* Goal-specific product performance data: Recommendations aren’t random or based on anecdotes about chemistry - they’re based on how products perform for specific consumer goals, like better sleep, stress relief, or enhanced focus.
* Flavor and aroma insights: With consumer feedback on terpene profiles, taste, and overall product enjoyment, the Virtual Budtender ensures that recommendations match both the desired effect and personal preference.
* AI insights informed by consumer reflections: Every suggestion is grounded in real people’s lived experiences, not marketing hype or guesswork. It’s the wisdom of the crowd at work.
Why This Matters:
* The cannabis market is vast and complex. Without guidance, customers often feel overwhelmed and make choices based on superficial factors like THC percentage or price.
* Jointly’s Virtual Budtender demystifies this complexity by combining cutting-edge AI with authentic, goal-specific data. This ensures every recommendation helps your customers find products that truly work for them.
This is more than just AI - it’s a trusted guide, empowering customers with knowledge and making your dispensary the go-to source for expert cannabis advice, both in-store and online.
