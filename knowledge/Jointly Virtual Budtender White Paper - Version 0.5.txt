Section I: The Nature of Consumer Queries and the Role of the Virtual Budtender
Cannabis consumers arrive at dispensary websites with diverse needs and intentions, ranging from finding products for specific use cases to seeking educational guidance or operational clarity. Understanding these queries is essential to transforming website visits into successful transactions and long-term relationships.
Jointly’s analysis of consumer interactions with the Virtual Budtender highlights the following themes:
1. Goal-Oriented Queries
Consumers frequently search with a specific outcome in mind - better sleep, reduced stress, enhanced creativity, or physical relief. For example:
* “What’s the best flower for stress relief?”
* “Edibles to help me sleep through the night?”
* “Vapes for focus and energy?”
The Virtual Budtender translates these goals into precise, personalized product recommendations based on attributes like potency, cannabinoid content, and terpene profiles.
2. Product-Specific Queries
Many users arrive with preferences for certain product types (flower, edibles, tinctures) or attributes such as high THC content or dietary restrictions:
* “Highest THC flower?”
* “Sugar-free edibles?”
* “Tinctures for chronic pain?”
Additionally, searches for specific brands - like “Uncle Arnie’s” or “Scotty’s Mom” - highlight the importance of brand recognition in purchasing decisions.
3. Educational Queries
New and returning cannabis consumers alike often seek to deepen their understanding of products and effects:
* “What does limonene do?”
* “Difference between CBD and CBG?”
* “How much should I take if I’m new to edibles?”
The Virtual Budtender educates and empowers these users with clear, accessible information, reducing uncertainty and fostering trust.
4. Contextual Queries
Consumers also frame their needs within specific contexts, such as activities, scenarios, or medical concerns:
* Activities: “What’s good for hiking?”
* Social scenarios: “Something for a night out with friends?”
* Medical needs: “Help with anxiety or chronic pain.”
By understanding the user’s broader goals and context, the Virtual Budtender offers recommendations that feel highly relevant and actionable.
5. Transactional Queries
Operational questions remain common - e.g., “Do you deliver?”, “What are your store hours?”, “Do you accept debit cards?”.
Dispensaries using the Virtual Budtender report fewer calls and emails related to these simple inquiries, freeing up staff to focus on more meaningful customer interactions.

Section II: The Impact of the Virtual Budtender on Customer Behavior and Spending
Dispensary websites often encourage price-driven shopping behaviors that fail to align with customers’ true goals. The Virtual Budtender reframes the shopping experience around performance and outcomes, producing measurable improvements in user satisfaction and revenue.
Key Outcomes from Jointly’s Pilot Programs:
1. Higher Transaction Values Through Purpose-Driven Shopping
Customers engaging with the Virtual Budtender spend 20%–40% more per transaction. Notably, this increase exceeds the growth in products per cart (15%–32%), as customers are choosing higher-value products that align with their goals. This shift represents a fundamental change:
   * Traditional cannabis e-commerce platforms encourage price competition, driving users toward cheaper products.
   * The Virtual Budtender shifts the focus to performance and outcomes, empowering users to invest in products that best meet their needs - whether for relaxation, focus, or wellness.
   * This means not just larger carts, but more profitable carts.
   2. Greater Confidence and Reduced Friction
By guiding users to products that match their goals and contexts, the Virtual Budtender reduces indecision and increases purchase confidence. This results in:
      * Fewer abandoned carts.
      * A higher likelihood of exploring complementary or premium products.
      3. Reduced Labor Costs and Operational Overhead
Although not yet fully quantified, pilot partners report a noticeable drop in calls and emails asking basic operational questions (e.g., store hours, parking, payment policies). This reduction saves time and labor, allowing dispensary staff to focus on high-value tasks and in-store experiences.
      4. Proven Software Expertise in Purposeful Cannabis Consumption
The Virtual Budtender builds on Jointly’s experience in empowering cannabis consumers. Jointly is the creator of the Jointly mobile app, where consumers increase the effectiveness and enjoyment of their cannabis experiences by nearly 50% on average. Through purposeful consumption, users learn to:
         * Define their goals.
         * Choose the right products.
         * Dial in critical factors (dose, setting, hydration, etc.) that impact their experience.
Jointly’s proven success with consumer-facing software ensures that the Virtual Budtender is not only effective but also user-friendly, delivering tangible results for dispensaries and their customers alike.
