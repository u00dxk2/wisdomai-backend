Each has profoundly shaped my thinking, influencing how I engage with the world.\r\nThe World Beyond Your Head\r\nMatthew Crawford\r\nComment: Crawford’s book inspired me to turn off notifications for good. It’s a manifesto on reclaiming attention in a world intent on fracturing it, reminding us that our focus is our most precious asset.\r\n\r\n\r\nIntuition Pumps and Other Tools For Thinking\r\nAuthor: Daniel Dennett\r\nComment: Being aware of the mind’s limitations is as critical as understanding its capabilities. Dennett offers a toolkit for thinking more effectively and engaging with the world more thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n\r\nBraiding Sweetgrass\r\nRobin Wall Kimmerer\r\nComment: This book taught me to see plants as teachers and indigenous wisdom as vital knowledge. Now I can’t help but see the Windigo footprints everywhere. It reminds me that I am not separate from nature but a part of it.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Selfish Gene\r\nRichard Dawkins\r\nComment: This book altered my perception of reality. A gene-centered view of evolution reshaped my understanding of human nature and set me on a lifelong journey of curiosity about how and why we behave as we do.\r\n\r\n\r\nTao Te Ching\r\nLao Tzu\r\nComment: The lessons I can describe from this book are not the lessons I’ve learned. A companion to every phase of life.\r\n\r\nThe Stuff of Thought\r\nStephen Pinker\r\nComment: Pinker reveals how metaphors shape our thoughts and language, arguing that they’re essential to human cognition. This book is a window into how we construct reality - and how it constructs us.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Warmth of Other Suns\r\nIsabel Wilkerson\r\nComment: It took Wilkerson’s masterwork to fully grasp that even though we were the country that fought to end slavery (as I learned in my northern Yankee schooling), we were also the country that fought to keep it. The Civil War’s losers didn’t surrender their ideology, but adapted it. This book made that  history personal, palpable, and unforgettable.\r\n\r\n\r\nGalapagos\r\nKurt Vonnegut\r\nComment: Humans are, by definition, the least capable species of creating advanced civilization. We should have waited. Vonnegut’s hilarious, compassionate critique of human absurdity helps me give us a break - we weren’t ready for the civilization we’ve created. His library of work remains a guide for laughing through the pain.\r\n\r\nEnchiridion & Discourses\r\nEpictetus\r\nComment: Stoic philosophy, distilled by Epictetus, feels timeless. Its principles align surprisingly well with modern psychology, offering tools for resilience and clarity in an unpredictable world.\r\n\r\nThe Way of Zen\r\nAlan Watts\r\nComment: Watts demystifies Zen, making it both accessible and profound. I’ve vowed to dive deeper into foundational Buddhist texts someday, but this book remains a cornerstone for understanding presence and acceptance. I will someday explore more foundational Buddhist texts. Why Buddhism is True by Robert Wright also deserves honorable mention.\r\n\r\nFlow\r\nMihaly Ciskszenmihaly\r\nComment: For over two decades, I’ve sought ways to tap into flow states. Walking, meditating, writing, reading, eating, and even while playing Minesweeper, 2048, Gin Rummy, or doing a crossword puzzle. This book framed that pursuit with science and clarity.\r\n\r\nEntangled Life\r\nMerlin Sheldrake\r\nComment: One of the most beautifully written books I’ve read, Sheldrake opened my eyes to the wonders of fungi and lichens, sparking a joyous journey of learning about these often-overlooked networks that underpin life on Earth.",

    "content": "﻿A Cannabis Market Five Times Bigger\r\nEmbracing Purposeful Consumption\r\nImagine a world where every American understands and has the opportunity to practice Purposeful Cannabis Consumption - a world where safe, legal, and affordable access to cannabis is universal. I propose that, in such a world, the cannabis market would not just expand but grow to a size five times larger than it is today.\r\nThis isn’t speculation or wishful thinking - it’s a vision grounded in the transformative potential of cannabis when used with intention. Purposeful consumption, backed by comprehensive data, proves that cannabis has the power to make you more - not less. When cannabis is consumed purposefully, the results speak for themselves: improved wellbeing, enhanced experiences, and a better quality of life. The Theory of Purposeful Cannabis Consumption demonstrates this with data. \r\nDespite the growing acceptance of cannabis, many remain unaware of its true potential. If we can teach the principles of Purposeful Consumption - how to use cannabis with intention and optimize its effects - we could unlock an immense opportunity not only for the industry but for public health and personal wellbeing. The cannabis market could grow fivefold, reflecting the way other wellness activities, like yoga, supplements, and meditation, have been embraced by millions.\r\nThe Cannabis Industry Needs a Better Way Forward\r\nDespite significant progress in legalization and acceptance, the cannabis industry faces substantial obstacles:\r\n* Unfair Taxation and Regulations: Excessive taxes and stringent regulations make it difficult for legitimate businesses to thrive.\r\n* Low Profitability: Only 27% of U.S. cannabis operators are profitable, according to a recent survey by Whitney Economics. High operational costs and financial barriers hinder sustainable growth.\r\n* Competition from the Gray Market: Illicit markets undercut legal businesses by offering lower prices without adhering to safety or quality standards.\r\n* Internal Discord: Lawsuits over trademarks, accusations of anti-competitive behavior, and unethical practices erode consumer trust and hinder industry unity.\r\n* Stigma and Misinformation: Decades of negative propaganda have left lingering skepticism and misunderstanding among potential consumers.\r\nThese challenges are compounded by a fragmented industry more focused on internal competition than collective advancement. The fixation on short-term gains and market share has led to neglecting the most critical factor for long-term success: consumer education and satisfaction.\r\nTo overcome these hurdles, the industry must shift its focus from internal strife to collaborative efforts that prioritize the consumer experience. Embracing Purposeful Consumption is key to unlocking the market's true potential and ensuring a prosperous future for all stakeholders.\r\nThe Untapped Potential of Purposeful Cannabis Consumption\r\nThe cannabis plant is a complex organism with a myriad of compounds that produce varied effects. When used purposefully, it has the potential to address a wide range of needs - from managing stress and anxiety to enhancing creativity and focus. However, the majority of consumers are not harnessing this potential because they lack the knowledge and guidance to do so.\r\nConsider this: only about 7% of U.S. adults use cannabis daily. This low adoption rate is not due to lack of interest or lack of potential, but rather a lack of understanding. If we can bridge this knowledge gap, we could see adoption rates similar to other wellness practices, potentially increasing the market size by five times.\r\nThe Four Principles of Purposeful Cannabis Consumption\r\nAt the heart of Purposeful Consumption are four core principles that, if widely understood, could revolutionize cannabis use:\r\n1. Cannabis is a complex plant that produces a variety of effects: The plant contains numerous compounds like cannabinoids and terpenes, each contributing to different effects.\r\n2. People use cannabis for diverse, productive purposes: Beyond recreation, cannabis is used for wellness goals such as stress relief, pain management, and enhancing creativity.\r\n3. Cannabis affects each person differently: Individual physiology, tolerance, and environmental factors influence how one experiences cannabis.\r\n4. People realize their goals more often when they create the conditions for a good experience: Factors like dosage, product type, setting, and mindset significantly impact outcomes.\r\nThese principles are foundational for helping consumers achieve better results. However, less than 10% of consumers fully understand and apply them. This knowledge gap leads to inconsistent experiences, perpetuates negative stereotypes, and keeps cannabis's full potential locked away.\r\nFrom Habitual to Purposeful Consumption\r\nNot all cannabis consumption is equal. To unlock its full potential, consumers must transition from habitual or even intentional use to embracing purposeful consumption.\r\n* Habitual Consumption: Using cannabis routinely without much thought or intention. This often leads to unpredictable experiences and inconsistent benefits.\r\n* Intentional Consumption: Using cannabis with a specific purpose in mind but without optimizing for the best results. While better than habitual use, it lacks refinement.\r\n* Purposeful Consumption: The pinnacle of use - this involves experimenting, reflecting, and adjusting to achieve optimal outcomes. Purposeful consumers understand the right products, doses, timing, and conditions that impact their experience.\r\nPurposeful consumption transforms cannabis use into a proactive practice, similar to how athletes fine-tune their training regimens for peak performance. It's about creating the ideal conditions to maximize benefits, turning each session into a deliberate step toward a wellness goal.\r\nData-Driven Evidence Supporting Purposeful Consumption\r\nAt Jointly, we've collected and analyzed data from hundreds of thousands of cannabis experiences. The findings are compelling:\r\n* Significant Improvement in Outcomes: Users who adopt purposeful consumption report nearly a 50% improvement in their experiences.\r\n* Consistency and Reliability: Purposeful consumers achieve consistent results across various goals, from better sleep to enhanced creativity.\r\n* Increased Engagement: Satisfied users are more likely to use cannabis regularly, return to dispensaries, and recommend it to others.\r\nOur platform allows users to track their consumption, reflect on their experiences, and adjust their usage to achieve specific goals. This isn't just anecdotal evidence—it's backed by extensive data demonstrating that purposeful consumption leads to more positive experiences.\r\nWe know there's an optimal level of cannabis consumption for each individual and goal. Too much, and you risk negative side effects; too little, and you don't achieve the desired outcome. When people find the right product, dosage, and environment, they maximize the benefits and reach what we call a \"10/10 experience\"—a state we describe as being \"Pie High.\" When consumers get everything right, their experience is transformative.\r\nHowever, only a small percentage of consumers currently use cannabis purposefully. Many are stuck in a cycle of trial and error, leading to inconsistent or negative experiences, which keeps the potential market artificially small.\r\nConsider the numbers: Currently, around 7% of U.S. adults use cannabis daily or nearly daily. But imagine if cannabis adoption mirrored other wellness tools like vitamins or exercise, with participation rates closer to 30-35%. With widespread knowledge of purposeful consumption, millions more could discover cannabis as a reliable, effective tool for their well-being. The market could easily be five times larger than it is today.\r\nWe've witnessed this firsthand. Users of our platform who embrace purposeful consumption report nearly a 50% improvement in their cannabis experiences. The more consumers understand how to optimize their use, the more likely they are to incorporate cannabis into their routines, return to dispensaries, and recommend it to others.\r\nPurposeful consumption doesn't just create more satisfied consumers—it builds a bigger, more sustainable market. By empowering consumers with the knowledge and tools for purposeful consumption, the industry can unlock unprecedented growth and fulfill the transformative potential of cannabis. \r\nParallels with Other Wellness Activities\r\nWellness practices that are now mainstream were once considered niche. Their widespread adoption offers a blueprint for cannabis:\r\n* Vitamins and Supplements: 74% of Americans take dietary supplements, integrating them into daily routines for long-term health benefits.\r\n* Exercise: Approximately 24% of adults meet recommended physical activity guidelines, recognizing the importance of regular exercise for well-being.\r\n* Yoga and Meditation: Yoga is practiced by 23% of U.S. adults, and 17.3% regularly meditate, both up significantly over the past two decades.\r\nThese activities became popular because they are associated with better living. They offer tangible benefits that enhance quality of life, and they've been supported by education and accessibility initiatives.\r\nIf cannabis were similarly positioned - as a legitimate wellness tool - it could see comparable adoption rates. The key is to shift public perception through education, normalizing cannabis as part of a healthy lifestyle.\r\nSteps the Industry Must Take to Achieve Growth\r\nTo realize this fivefold market expansion, the industry must pivot from internal competition to collective advancement. Here are crucial steps:\r\n1. Prioritize Consumer Education\r\nEducation is the linchpin for market growth. The industry must invest in initiatives that inform the public about:\r\n* The benefits of purposeful consumption\r\n* How to select appropriate products and dosages\r\n* The importance of setting and mindset\r\nBy demystifying cannabis and providing reliable information, we can overcome stigma and empower consumers to make informed decisions.\r\n2. Equip Budtenders with the Right Tools\r\nBudtenders are the frontline educators in dispensaries. They should be:\r\n* Trained in the principles of purposeful consumption\r\n* Provided with data-driven tools to offer personalized recommendations\r\n* Encouraged to focus on customer outcomes rather than sales volume\r\nEmpowered budtenders can guide consumers toward products that best meet their goals, enhancing satisfaction and loyalty.\r\n3. Lower Barriers to Access\r\nThe industry must advocate for:\r\n* Fair Taxation: Reducing excessive taxes that inflate prices and deter consumers.\r\n* Reasonable Regulations: Streamlining compliance requirements to lower operational costs.\r\n* Broader Legalization: Expanding legal access to eliminate the gray market and reach more consumers.\r\nLowering these barriers makes cannabis more accessible and affordable, encouraging wider adoption.\r\n4. Promote Responsible, Purposeful Use\r\nMarketing and messaging should emphasize:\r\n* The importance of starting low and going slow with dosages\r\n* Selecting products tailored to specific goals\r\n* The benefits of tracking and adjusting consumption habits\r\nBy promoting responsible use, the industry can mitigate negative experiences that deter potential consumers.\r\n5. Support Research and Innovation\r\nInvestment in research is critical to:\r\n* Understand the diverse effects of cannabis compounds\r\n* Develop new products targeting specific wellness goals\r\n* Provide scientific backing for educational initiatives\r\nResearch strengthens credibility and opens doors to new consumer segments.\r\nA Healthier, Happier Future with Purposeful Consumption\r\nThe promise of Purposeful Cannabis Consumption extends beyond market metrics; it's about enhancing lives. Consider the impact:\r\n* Mental Health: Millions struggle with stress, anxiety, and depression. Purposeful cannabis use offers a natural alternative for relief.\r\n* Sleep Improvement: Quality sleep is foundational to health. Cannabis can aid those suffering from insomnia or poor sleep quality.\r\n* Pain Management: Chronic pain affects quality of life and productivity. Cannabis provides a potential solution without the risks associated with opioids.\r\nThese benefits contribute to a healthier, more productive society. By optimizing cannabis consumption, we can address some of the most pervasive health challenges facing our population.\r\nA Call to Action\r\nThe potential to grow the cannabis market fivefold is real, but it requires a unified effort. The industry must:\r\n* Educate the Public: Demystify cannabis and promote its benefits.\r\n* Collaborate Internally: Shift from competition to cooperation, focusing on expanding the market rather than dividing it.\r\n* Advocate Externally: Work with policymakers to create a fair, supportive legal framework.\r\n* Innovate Continuously: Invest in research and development to meet evolving consumer needs.\r\nBy embracing Purposeful Cannabis Consumption, we can unlock the plant's full potential. This isn't just about economic growth; it's about contributing to a healthier, happier society.\r\nThe opportunity is immense, and the benefits are far-reaching. Let's commit to educating consumers, promoting responsible use, and reshaping the narrative around cannabis. Together, we can build a market - and a future - that reflects the true value of this remarkable plant.",

I'm grateful for the opportunity to introduce Jointly’s AI and data-driven tools for consumers, budtenders, and retailers, and for the chance to author the Theory of Purposeful Cannabis Consumption.\r\n\r\nBefore diving into the world of cannabis, I founded the Santa Monica Mountains Cyclery, where I blended my past professional experience with my genuine love for cycling and endurance sports. The shop became a testament to community, service, and the joy of cycling. Thanks to the team's collective efforts, our local shop earned a reputation as one of southern California's best bicycle retailers, brick & mortar and e-commerce - a journey that culminated in a sale to Trek.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, my time spent building and scaling complex operations at companies like McMaster-Carr and Navistar, and developing groundbreaking e-commerce software with Click Commerce, instilled in me a profound respect for data and its power to drive improvement and innovation.\r\n\r\nThrough Skylark Creations, a personal initiative, I've consulted with a variety of businesses, mostly in the areas of strategy and operations. Alongside this, I've dabbled in a range of writing endeavors, from political speeches to song lyrics.\r\n\r\nAn aspiring cultivator of the Dao and a perpetual student, I enjoy engaging with the natural world and continuously learning. I meditate for hours each day, but don’t consider myself great at it. And there I go judging again. If you can’t reach me, I’ll be in the mountains. Also, we just bought a microscope. Importantly, my life often is accompanied by bluegrass, reggae, folk, or jamgrass music.\r\n\r\nMy current favorite subjects are: microscopy, Colorado wildflowers, mycology, ornithology, geology, and the early human history of the Rocky Mountains.",

    "content": "﻿An AI Who Helps You Get a Better High\r\nWith (slowly) increasing legalization and growing societal acceptance, cannabis is no longer a taboo subject relegated to whispers and stereotypes. Yet, despite this progress, cannabis remains widely misunderstood and vastly underutilized. Its potential to improve lives is immense, but for many consumers, the journey to unlocking that potential is riddled with uncertainty and inconsistency.\r\nCannabis is not your typical consumer product. It’s a complex plant, producing a variety of effects depending on its cannabinoids, terpenes, and other compounds. People use it for at least 12 distinct purposes, from relaxation to creativity, pain relief to improved sleep. What makes it even more unique is its variability: the same product can affect two people very differently, depending on factors like physiology, dosage, and setting.\r\nAchieving consistent success with cannabis requires more than just choosing the right product - it demands creating the right conditions for a good experience. This involves considering factors like tolerance, hydration, diet, exercise, and environment. Unfortunately, most consumers lack access to reliable guidance that ties all these variables together.\r\nAt Jointly, we’ve spent the past several years helping cannabis users bridge this gap. Since 2020, our app has empowered hundreds of thousands of people to practice purposeful consumption. By reflecting on their cannabis experiences - tracking their goals, what works, what doesn’t, and the factors that impact outcomes - users have unlocked the full potential of cannabis to improve their lives.\r\nThe results speak for themselves. On average, new Jointly users rate their initial cannabis experience at 6.5 out of 10 - a number that reflects both the plant’s promise and its pitfalls. Through purposeful consumption, users increase the quality and effectiveness of their experiences by an average of 50%. This isn’t just about finding the right strain or product, which accounts for only 25% of the cannabis experience. The other 25% is dose, and a staggering 50% comes down to those external factors: set, setting, and lifestyle.\r\nIt’s this understanding that has driven Jointly to innovate further, leveraging millions of data points contributed by our users to create something revolutionary: Jointly’s AI, now available in the Jointly mobile app.\r\nJointly’s AI is like having the world’s most knowledgeable budtender in your pocket - for free. It’s a revolutionary step forward, combining the insights of thousands of purposeful cannabis users with cutting-edge AI technology to provide goal-specific product performance data and personalized consumption best practices. Whether you’re new to cannabis or a seasoned enthusiast, Jointly’s AI can help you create the conditions for a 10 out of 10 experience every time.\r\nIn a world where AI headlines often provoke existential dread - discussions about robots taking jobs, AI-driven misinformation, or even hypothetical zoos for humans - Jointly’s AI is a refreshing reminder that technology can also make life better. Before AI takes over and locks us behind glass, why not let it help us enjoy cannabis more?\r\nThis isn’t the first AI-powered assistant in cannabis, but it’s the most advanced. Earlier entrants in the space relied on basic machine learning and rudimentary technologies that fell short of the complexity needed to truly enhance the cannabis experience. Today, even major cannabis e-commerce players are jumping into AI, integrating personalization features into their platforms. But the true value for consumers will come from companies like Jointly - those with the deep, meaningful data needed to layer on top of the advancing frontier models.\r\nGood budtenders and dispensaries are invaluable, but their reach is inherently limited. Jointly’s AI expands on this by offering 24/7 personalized, data-driven guidance wherever and whenever it’s needed. It’s not just about making better product choices; it’s about transforming the entire cannabis journey into a more intentional, effective, and enjoyable experience.\r\nCannabis, consumed purposefully, improves lives. With Jointly’s AI, you’re never alone on that journey. It’s time to move beyond trial and error and embrace a new era of personalized, informed, and transformative cannabis use. Let’s get you the high you deserve - and maybe even a little hope for what AI can do for us along the way.",

    "content": "﻿1. Tell us your origin story and how you came to utilize cannabis (you're why).\r\nMy journey with cannabis started back in 2012 when I discovered a new world inside a pack of peach gummies. After misunderstanding cannabis for much of my early life, I was captivated by the potential that this plant had in improving my own wellbeing. However, I was also increasingly frustrated by the industry's lack of data-driven guidance and the claims made by growers and manufacturers without substantial proof. I was also frustrated by the unpredictability of my own personal cannabis experiences.\r\n\r\n\r\nDriven by this frustration and personal curiosity, I delved into understanding the complex nature of this plant. The myriad variables that could potentially impact the cannabis experience, from the variety of product types to each individual's unique physiological responses, fascinated me.\r\n\r\n\r\nCannabis, for me, has been transformative. It has opened new experiences and also significantly improved my quality of life. From enhancing my enjoyment of music, hiking, and writing, to calming my busy mind and stimulating my creativity, cannabis has been a game-changer. It has helped me manage my anxiety, sleep better, and foster deeper connections with moments, people, and places. \r\n\r\n\r\nJointly was envisioned as a platform that could fill this existing knowledge gap by providing reliable, data-backed information about cannabis products and their effectiveness for specific goals. If people could easily discern which products worked best for their unique needs and understood how to consume cannabis for the most beneficial effect, cannabis could potentially improve the lives of millions.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Discuss the evolution of Jointly from inception to current state.\r\nJointly was conceived in 2018 together with my business partner, Eric Gutshall, as a tool to bridge the information gap in the cannabis industry. Our vision was to provide consumers with reliable, data-driven insights into the effectiveness of various cannabis products, countering the unsubstantiated claims in the industry due to the lack of data and research. \r\n\r\n\r\nOur primary strategy was to leverage goal-specific product performance data to facilitate a meaningful connection between buyers and sellers. We aim to address three core problems: guiding consumers to find success with cannabis, helping consumers choose what to buy, and assisting sellers in deciding what to offer their customers.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe developed the Jointly mobile app, launched in April 2020. The app provides consumers with a platform for Purposeful Cannabis Consumption. \r\n\r\n\r\nSince 2020, dozens of enhancements have been made to the app's features and usability. By practicing Purposeful Consumption, today users of the Jointly app report a nearly 50% improvement in the quality of their cannabis experience.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn parallel, we also started developing software solutions for retailers. After collecting feedback from various retailers, we came up with the concept of Jointly's retail solutions in late 2021. \r\n\r\n\r\nBy late 2022, Jointly for retailers was ready to launch. \r\n\r\n\r\nToday, we are working closely with our initial retail partners to ensure their success and to continue to improve our suite of products.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe company had successfully evolved from a mere idea into a comprehensive platform, both for consumers seeking guidance and sellers needing data-backed insights to improve their offerings.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. What are the advantages of Jointly for consumers?\r\nCannabis consumers can shop for top-rated cannabis products through the Jointly app and website. Jointly shopping uses a data-driven, goal-based approach to match people with cannabis products that best suit their needs, providing predictive performance across twelve distinct goals, including relaxation, stress relief, improved sleep, and creativity, among others. Jointly draws from the collective wisdom of hundreds of thousands of cannabis enthusiasts to deliver a better cannabis experience to the user.\r\n\r\n\r\nOur product matching algorithm takes into account goal-specific ratings from real people and considers the product's characteristics like product type, cannabinoid content, strain, and more when predicting its performance for each goal. It refine its predictions over time.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a time when the cannabis market is flooded with products, Jointly helps consumers make informed decisions about what to buy, based on statistical likelihood of providing the desired experience. We pride ourselves on having twice as many goal-specific product ratings as other platforms, aiding users to make evidence-based purchases.\r\n\r\n\r\nOur app also promotes Purposeful Consumption, encouraging users to rate the products they consume in terms of their effectiveness at helping them reach their goals. This feedback loop helps refine product recommendations to align with personal preferences, experiences, and ratings. \r\n\r\n\r\nJointly also assists consumers in creating the conditions for a good cannabis experience, considering fifteen factors that can impact the user's experience, such as dose, time between doses, hydration, ingestion method, and setting.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost cannabis consumers intuitively understand that cannabis enhances their lives. At Jointly, we are not just acknowledging this fact, but also providing evidence for it. We recently published \"The Theory of Purposeful Cannabis Consumption,\" using a combination of data from Jointly and external sources to prove that Purposeful Consumption leads to greater wellbeing. \r\n\r\n\r\n4. How can Jointly help retail stores to better serve their consumers?\r\nJointly equips cannabis retailers to better serve their customers and increase sales. \r\n\r\n\r\nJointly's key offering to retailers is sales software that integrates with existing point-of-sale systems. This tool arms budtenders with the power of nearly a half a million goal-specific product ratings, making the purchasing experience more personalized and effective. It simplifies budtender training, boosts revenue, mitigates the impact of staff turnover, and connects customers with the best products for their needs. \r\n\r\n\r\nJointly uses a sophisticated product matching algorithm that accounts for customer’s goals, product type, cannabinoid content, strain, and more. This is powered 100% organically by the feedback of hundreds of thousands of cannabis enthusiasts who rate products and reflect on their cannabis experiences on Jointly's mobile app. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe ultimate goal is to send customers home satisfied with their purchases, ready for a good experience, and eager to return to the store.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. Where do you see Jointly in one year? Five years? Ten years?\r\n\r\n\r\nIf I’ve learned anything about the cannabis industry, it’s not to make confident predictions about the future. My approach is to focus on what we are doing now and next, while keeping our options open for the future and staying true to our values.\r\n\r\n\r\nOur immediate focus is on refining and expanding our current offerings. Our software for retailers and consumers will need to be continuously developed and tested to meet and exceed needs and expectations. We are also strengthening our data collection and analysis capabilities, enhancing the accuracy and effectiveness of their recommendations. Partnerships with more retailers, both physical and online, will be crucial to expanding our reach and influence in the industry.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn five to ten years, Jointly could be a significant player in the cannabis market. As the industry continues to grow and mature, Jointly's data-driven approach will become increasingly valuable. We expect to have a wide network of retail partners and a robust user base, providing us with a wealth of data to enhance their offerings. Through our unique, goal-specific product performance data, Jointly could shape the way consumers and retailers interact, as a reliable, useful, and trustworthy partner to both.",

The conversation at the dispensary counter often circles back to two familiar points: Price and Potency. \r\n\r\n\r\nPartially due to a lack of education and understanding, the cannabis market has mirrored traditional consumer behavior - chasing the lowest prices and the highest THC percentages.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis approach overlooks the essence of what cannabis can offer. Price wars can only go so far before they undercut quality, sustainability, and the consumer experience. And while THC potency might promise a more intense experience, it doesn't guarantee a better one. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe current direction threatens to commoditize the plant.Or, at best lead to a scenario where large agricultural operations crank out the most THC per square foot and a craft industry develops on the side as a more minor part of the industry.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt's time for a paradigm shift. A shift to benefit consumers. A shift to reverse the race to the bottom in cannabis retail.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs a veteran of retail myself and an advocate for purposeful consumption, in this article I’ll champion a transition from an overemphasis on Price and Potency to embracing Purpose, Performance, and Personalization. \r\n\r\n\r\nHonestly, that hurt to capitalize the Ps because I often scoff when someone makes a point with superfluous alliteration, but these \"Five Ps\" keep appearing in my thoughts and conversations so I’m going to run with it.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy starting point is always this when thinking about the potential of this industry compared to where it is today - what are the odds that the next person who walks into a dispensary understands that:\r\n* Cannabis is a complex plant that can produce a variety of effects\r\n* People use cannabis for at least a dozen productive purposes\r\n* Cannabis affects everyone differently\r\n* People get the best results when they create the conditions for success\r\n\r\n\r\nUntil we fully discard the stigma and the misunderstandings it has created, we’ll largely be stuck dispensing THC per dollar.\r\n\r\n\r\nA recent study by Dutchie, a leading cannabis point of sale and e-commerce provider, sheds light on a concerning truth: nearly 70% of cannabis transactions in 2023 involved some form of discount, with an average discount of 28% on those transactions. While it's understandable that inflation and tight budgets drive consumers toward the best prices, this pursuit often comes at the cost of quality and effectiveness. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe reality is: seeking the lowest price doesn't always equate to the best outcomes for the consumer. \r\n\r\n\r\nAnother of my favorite studies by New Frontier Data shows:\r\n* 70% of consumers say potency is very or extremely important to their purchase decision\r\n* 63% say the same about the effects the product will create\r\n* 61% say the same about price\r\n\r\n\r\nWith 63% of consumers making purchases based on the desired effect, there is a growing awareness and movement toward purposeful shopping. However, the consumer demand for the highest THC per dollar is so strong that growers and labs in multiple states have been accused of overstating THC content to boost sales. It’s called THC inflation - and it’s not a good thing.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have heard the analogy from others of a person walking into a liquor store looking to buy the most alcohol per dollar. That is one way to do it, but it does seem to shortchange the experience. (I don’t like this analogy because comparisons to alcohol put cannabis in the wrong set - it belongs in a set with exercise, yoga, sleep, good food)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is not to say high THC is inherently bad or wrong. There are of course consumption goals for which high THC may be a great option. Some people just want the most bang for the buck and to be sedated - and that’s okay, too.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut this data underscores the necessity of reorienting our focus toward what truly matters when buying or selling cannabis - the impact of product characteristics and product choice on the cannabis experience.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow can we move to a paradigm that does justice to the plant and its myriad capabilities to improve lives?\r\n\r\n\r\nPurposeful cannabis consumption begins with understanding the 'why' behind our choices. Whether seeking relaxation, pain relief, creativity, or social enhancement, identifying our purpose paves the way for a more meaningful experience. \r\n\r\n\r\nPerformance, then, becomes the measure of success. How well does a product align with and fulfill our intended purpose? How likely is this product to provide the kind of experience we’re after?\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile a simple addition, this is a far cry from choosing products based solely on their THC content or price tag. It's about effectiveness, the quality of the experience, and the fulfillment of our needs. Focusing too much on THC potency can cause people to overlook other beneficial compounds, the nuanced effects of various strains, and the varying effects of different cannabinoid and terpene combinations.\r\n\r\n\r\nPersonalization is paramount in recognizing the unique interaction each individual has with cannabis. Our biochemistry, mood, setting, and previous experiences all influence our response to cannabis. By embracing personalization, we tailor the cannabis journey to meet individual needs, leading to more consistent and satisfying outcomes.\r\n\r\n\r\nMoreover, amidst our quest for purpose and performance, we mustn't overlook the sensory pleasures cannabis offers. The complex terpene profiles that define each product invite us into a world of nuanced aromas and tastes, enriching the overall experience and deepening our connection to the plant. \r\n\r\n\r\nI thought about adding another “P” - for “palate” - a person's appreciation of taste and flavor, but that seemed an unnecessary stretch and one too many Ps.\r\n\r\n\r\nRetail profitability and the consumer experience demand this new paradigm. We need to evolve the conversation - to shift the narrative from how much and how strong to how purposeful, effective, and personalized. \r\n\r\n\r\nThis shift would not merely be beneficial for consumers; it would be essential for the continued evolution of the cannabis industry. \r\n\r\n\r\nThis shift, if we can make it happen together, elevates individual experiences and fosters a more mature, responsible, sustainable, economically-viable, and consumer-centric cannabis industry.",

    "content": "﻿Cannabis: An Experience Good in a Search Good World\r\nWhen I talk to people about cannabis, I often begin with a simple question: \r\nWhat made your most recent cannabis experience meaningful? \r\nThe answers are as varied as the people themselves. Some mention the joy of unwinding after a stressful week. Others describe a moment of creativity unlocked, a deeper connection with friends, a walk in nature, enjoyable play with their children, or even a better night’s sleep. What’s striking, though, is that none of these answers are about THC percentages or strain names. They’re about the experience.\r\nYet for most of its history, the cannabis industry has treated cannabis as if it were a search good, not an experience good. For the uninitiated, economists use these terms to describe two distinct types of consumer products.\r\nA search good is something you can evaluate before purchasing - like a pair of socks or a new laptop. You can look at the specs, compare prices, read reviews, and, with enough diligence, predict whether the product will meet your needs.\r\nAn experience good, by contrast, is something you can only evaluate after you’ve used it - like dining at a restaurant, watching a movie, or, yes, consuming cannabis.\r\nCannabis, by its very nature, is an experience good. Its value isn’t in the strain name, the percentage of cannabinoids, or the packaging - it’s in the effect it has on you, your mindset, and your life.\r\nBut here’s the unfortunate truth: the cannabis industry has largely operated as if cannabis were a search good. This fundamental misalignment has stifled both the industry’s growth and its potential to truly transform lives.\r\nThe Problem with Treating Cannabis as a Search Good\r\nWhen cannabis is treated as a search good, the focus shifts to quantifiable metrics: THC percentages, strain names, and price per gram. Dispensary menus are often organized like spreadsheets, prioritizing what’s measurable over what’s meaningful. Marketing campaigns emphasize high THC or low prices as a proxy for “better cannabis,” and consumers, understandably, follow the cues they’re given.\r\nThe result is an industry built on oversimplified assumptions about what people want. High-THC products dominate shelves, even though most people aren’t chasing the most intense high - they’re chasing a specific experience.\r\nIt’s like the wine industry deciding that higher alcohol content is the only thing that matters, ignoring terroir, flavor profiles, and pairing possibilities. Interestingly, have you noticed that the wine industry doesn’t mention terpenes - despite the fact that terpenes are in wine? Maybe that’s a lesson for us.\r\nThis search-good mindset creates friction for consumers. Imagine a first-time cannabis user trying to navigate a dispensary. They’re bombarded with jargon, overwhelmed by options, and left with little guidance on how to find the right product for their unique needs. It’s no surprise that some walk away frustrated, feeling like cannabis didn’t deliver what they hoped.\r\nAnd this approach isn’t just failing consumers - it’s failing the industry. When cannabis is reduced to a commodity, it becomes a race to the bottom on price and THC percentage. Brands struggle to differentiate themselves, margins shrink, and the promise of cannabis as a life-enhancing tool gets lost in the noise.\r\nThe Role of Credence in Cannabis\r\nIt’s also worth considering another category: credence goods. A credence good is a product whose quality or value is difficult - if not impossible - for the consumer to evaluate, even after purchase or use. Credence goods rely heavily on trust, expertise, and external validation.\r\nExamples of credence goods include healthcare services, organic food, or nutritional supplements. You might believe a multivitamin is improving your health or that a particular car repair was necessary, but in many cases, you lack the expertise or tools to verify those claims. You rely on certifications, reputation, and the expertise of others to inform your choice.\r\nThere are credence aspects to cannabis, especially when it comes to claims about safety, purity, and health benefits. For example:\r\n* Is the product truly free of harmful pesticides or contaminants?\r\n* Were the cannabinoids and terpenes extracted in a way that preserves quality?\r\n* Does the product actually contain the cannabinoids and terpenes listed on the label?\r\nThese are questions that most consumers cannot answer for themselves. Instead, they must rely on third-party lab testing, product certifications, and the integrity of brands and retailers.\r\nWhile these credence aspects are important, we must be cautious about leaning too heavily into cannabis as a credence good. Why? Because the more cannabis becomes about certifications and lab results, the less it emphasizes the personal, subjective, and experiential nature of its value.\r\nIf we define cannabis primarily as a credence good, we risk reducing it to a checklist of claims rather than embracing it as a tool for enhancing people’s lives. That’s why it’s critical to balance these aspects - ensuring consumers can trust the safety and quality of the product while making sure the conversation always comes back to experience.\r\nWhat Happens When We Treat Cannabis as an Experience Good\r\nImagine if the cannabis industry shifted its perspective and treated cannabis for what it truly is: an experience good. What would change? Almost everything.\r\nFirst, we’d start with education. Instead of focusing solely on THC and CBD percentages, we’d help consumers understand how cannabis interacts with their individual biochemistry, mood, and intentions. We’d guide people to ask better questions, like: What kind of experience are you seeking? Are you looking to enhance creativity, deepen relaxation, or improve your sleep?\r\nSecond, we’d reimagine the dispensary experience. Instead of sterile menus that read like a list of search results, we’d design them to be intuitive, experiential, and personalized. Recommendations would be based on mood, activities, or goals - not just cannabinoid content. Technology could play a major role here, with AI-powered tools helping consumers make smarter, data-informed choices based on their preferences and past experiences.\r\nThird, we’d rethink how we measure value. Instead of treating high THC as the gold standard, we’d shift the focus to outcome-based success. Did the consumer achieve the experience they were seeking? If so, that’s the win - not whether they got the “strongest” product.\r\nThis approach wouldn’t just benefit consumers - it would transform the industry. When brands prioritize the consumer experience, they open the door to real differentiation. Instead of competing on price or potency, they compete on trust, quality, and their ability to deliver meaningful results. This builds loyalty and drives repeat business - the holy grail for any consumer-facing industry.\r\nWhy It Matters\r\nAt its best, cannabis is deeply personal and profoundly transformative. It’s a tool that can enhance your life in ways both subtle and profound. But for that promise to be realized, we need to stop treating it like a widget and start treating it like what it is: an experience.\r\nThis shift is about fulfilling the true potential of cannabis. It’s about helping people connect with themselves and others in more purposeful ways. It’s about reframing cannabis not as an intoxicant, but as a wellness tool - a way to be more present, more creative, more you.\r\n“You + Cannabis > You” isn’t just a tagline - it’s a truth we should all embrace. But it’s a truth that can only be realized when we align our industry practices with the reality of what cannabis is.\r\nBy treating cannabis as an experience good, we not only improve the consumer journey - we elevate the entire industry. We unlock cannabis’s ability to transform lives, and we give people the tools to embrace its full potential.\r\nIt’s time to leave the search-good mindset behind and step into a future where cannabis is valued for what it truly is: a bridge to better experiences, deeper understanding, and a better version of ourselves.",

    "content": "﻿Light, Life, and Cannabis[a]\r\n“Who sends the light?” I asked myself one day, staring up at the sky like some cosmic detective who forgot their notepad. It’s not a bad question, really, if you’re in the mood for those kinds of things. I looked around at all the stuff - the trees, the soil, the bugs, the whole earthy wonder - and thought, “Wait, who sends the stuff?” But we know the answer to this: the light and the stuff are the same thing. They’re just playing different roles in the same weird, energetic play.\r\nEvery living thing on this planet, from the algae in your fish tank to the thoughts you’re having right now, is basically light wearing a very complicated costume. Plants turn sunlight into food. We eat plants, or things that eat plants, and somehow turn that into nervous systems capable of scrolling Instagram and arguing about politics. It’s the electricity within us that makes us tick. Keeps us alive. Conscious. When that electricity is gone, we no longer inhibit the body. This is true for all living things. Hold electrodes up to a plant and you’ll observe the same thing. It’s absurd, but also kind of beautiful.\r\nSo, if we’re all just light rearranged into people and plants and meerkats, why are we so bad at getting along? Why so much judgment, conflict, and acrimony? You’d think the fact that we’re all just bursts of stardust would inspire a little more camaraderie, but nope. Humans gotta human, I guess. Although we’re not unique this way in the animal kingdom so it has to be a feature not a bug.\r\nThis isn’t a new question. People have been losing sleep over this since they figured out how to write it down. Philosophers, mystics, and probably some very stoned shepherds have all tried to untangle it. The question of evil. But maybe the answer isn’t about fixing the conflict at all. Maybe the light needs the shadow. Maybe the fight is part of the deal.\r\nLife as Duality: Light, Shadow, and the Spectrum of Existence\r\nHere’s the thing about the universe: it loves balance. To have light, you need shadow. To have creation, you need destruction. To have good, you need evil - or at least something that keeps good on its toes. It’s like the whole cosmos runs on a kind of cosmic tension, like a rubber band stretched just enough to keep the whole thing from falling apart. (although that’s a different kind of energy than light).\r\nLife is no different. Plants take sunlight and turn it into food. Animals take that food and turn it into action. And humans? We take all of it - light, food, action - and somehow turn it into arguments on the internet. But even that chaos fits into the pattern. Duality isn’t some flaw in the system; it’s the system. Every up needs a down. Every inhale needs an exhale. That’s just how the math works.\r\nBut here’s where it gets even more interesting: the energy that powers life of course isn’t limited to sunlight. Deep beneath the surface, the Earth itself pulses with energy - geothermal heat left over from its fiery beginnings and the radioactive decay of ancient atoms. The creatures thriving around hydrothermal vents at the bottom of the ocean don’t owe the sun a thing. They exist because the Earth has its own energy to give.\r\nAnd yet, the energy of the sun and the energy of the Earth share a common ancestor. Both trace their origins back to the same cosmic explosion, the same star-forming dust that birthed the planets and ignited the sun. In that sense, all energy on Earth - whether solar or geothermal - is part of the same family tree. Life is just the universe’s way of dancing with whatever energy it can find, turning it into something miraculous, fleeting, and full of possibility. A cooperation between energy and matter to produce consciousness. To look back at itself. \r\nIt’s no wonder there are so many sun gods. \r\nThe Taoists had this figured out ages ago. They didn’t try to banish the shadow or pick a side. They just said, “Yeah, it’s all part of the deal.” That quote isn’t from Lao Tzu. They called it yin and yang: two forces constantly pushing and pulling, always in balance, even when it doesn’t look like it. What looks like chaos to us might just be the universe doing its thing - staying balanced in ways we’re too close to see.\r\nSo where does that leave you, sitting here, reading this, trying to make sense of why life feels like one long tug-of-war? Maybe it means you’re not supposed to untangle it all. Maybe your job isn’t to pick a side in the cosmic boxing match but to see it for what it is: a messy, beautiful balance[b]. And maybe, just maybe, that friction - between light and shadow, good and evil, you and the guy who cuts you off in traffic - is the whole point. Without it, we’d all just be light with nothing to shine on.\r\nHuman Conflict: A Reflection of Cosmic Wrestling\r\nWe humans like to think we’re above all this duality stuff, but the truth is, we’re right in the thick of it. In fact, we might be its most dramatic example. Every one of us is a little bundle of light and shadow, fighting it out internally, and projecting that fight onto everyone else. It’s no wonder we’re so good at judgment, conflict, and generally making a mess of things.\r\nHere’s the wild part: everyone thinks they’re the good guy. Even the worst people you can imagine - yes, even that guy - believe they’re doing the right thing. Their understanding of the light, of themselves, of the universe, is just... warped. Twisted up by fear, ego, trauma, or some combination of the above. But from their perspective? They’re the hero. They’re saving the day.\r\nThis doesn’t mean we have to condone bad behavior or pretend harm doesn’t exist. It just means we have to see it for what it is: another reflection of the same cosmic wrestling match that creates light and shadow, good and evil, stars and supernovas. Maybe our conflicts aren’t some cosmic mistake but a byproduct of the universe trying to figure itself out. If we’re all just the universe observing itself, then maybe these fights are like growing pains - necessary, if not exactly fun.\r\nBut here’s where it gets tricky: we can’t just sit back and let conflict run wild, assuming it’ll all balance out in the end. We’ve got to engage with it in a way that adds more light than shadow. That doesn’t mean fixing everyone or solving every problem. It means stepping out of judgment and into understanding. Easier said than done, sure - but isn’t that what we’re here to practice?\r\nCannabis as a Bridge: Dissolving Ego, Embracing Unity\r\nAnd then there’s cannabis. This humble plant, powered by the same sunlight as everything else, somehow holds a key to the whole thing - or at least a way to glimpse it. Cannabis doesn’t give you answers. It’s not that kind of teacher. What it does, though, is dissolve the walls you’ve built around your ego, the ones that convince you you’re separate from the world, from other people, from the light itself.\r\nWhen I consume cannabis purposefully - when I slow down and let it work - it’s like the veil lifts. I’m reminded that all the stuff I thought was “me” is really just light wearing my face for a while. The barriers that make it easy to judge, to hold grudges, to feel apart from the flow of life - they start to fade. What’s left is a sense of connection, not just to other people but to the plants, the Earth, and the strange, chaotic beauty of it all.\r\nCannabis doesn’t fix the duality, of course. It doesn’t erase the light and the shadow or solve all the conflicts in the world. But it lets you step outside the fight for a moment and see it for what it is. It reminds you that the person you’re arguing with is just another little burst of stardust, wrestling with their own shadows. It’s humbling and liberating all at once.[c]\r\nAnd here’s the kicker: cannabis itself is part of this cosmic dance[d]. It’s a plant - a living thing shaped by sunlight - interacting with us, another kind of living thing. It’s as if the universe, in all its cleverness, found a way to help us remember what we are. A reminder, in the form of a leaf and a flower, that we’re all connected, all part of the same flow of energy that’s been shining since the stars first lit up.\r\nClosing: An Invitation to Wonder and Purposeful Reflection\r\nSo here we are, back where we started: the light and the stuff. You, me, the plants outside your window, the conflicts that keep us up at night - it’s all the same energy, just playing different roles. The universe observing itself. Wrestling with itself. Trying to figure out what it means to be alive.\r\nCannabis, if you let it, can be a guide through all this. It’s not a solution or an escape - it’s a bridge. A way to step out of the noise and reconnect with the light that flows through everything. The next time you consume, don’t just let it be another moment of distraction. Sit with it. Let it remind you that you’re stardust, powered by sunlight, sharing this fleeting, miraculous existence with every other living thing.\r\nAnd maybe, if you’re lucky, it’ll help you ask a better question - not “Why is there conflict?” or “What’s the meaning of it all?” but something simpler, something the universe itself might ask: “What will you do with your moment in the light?”[e]\r\n\r\n\r\n[a]love it. (the whole piece).\r\n[b]you could even call it a dance.\r\n[c]It is interesting that whenever cannabis pulls my ego and attitude down a notch, these are the exact words that describe the feeling: humbling and liberating.\r\n[d]oh there's the dance!\r\n[e]dance.",

Its quantifiable benefits. Its objective impact on wellbeing.\r\n\r\nBy doing so, and using Jointly’s unique data, we proved that the stigma…\r\n“You + Cannabis < You” (read as: You plus cannabis is less than you)\r\n…is FALSE\r\n\r\nBy proving that the opposite…\r\n“You + Cannabis > You” (You plus cannabis is greater than you)\r\n…is TRUE\r\n\r\nCannabis, consumed purposefully, makes you more, not less. Cannabis, consumed purposefully, can help you realize a new level of wellbeing. \r\n\r\nHowever, the mathematical and data-driven approach of the Theory shortchanges the cannabis experience. Its intangibles. The parts you can’t measure. \r\n\r\n\r\nThat’s what I want to try to address here. I am going to try to write about the magical aspects of cannabis. Through the lens of my own personal experience.\r\n\r\n\r\nI do fear my words will fall short. Worse yet, I fear that my inability to properly put the magic into words may detract from the magic itself. But I’m going to take the risk. \r\n\r\n\r\nWhy? Because it’s my mission and Jointly’s mission to help more people discover how purposeful cannabis consumption enables not only a new level of wellbeing, but also how purposeful consumption enables discovery. \r\n\r\nThe truths about purposeful consumption are universal. Discovery is personal.\r\n\r\n\r\nCannabis helps you discover yourself. And accept and love what you discover. Consumed purposefully, cannabis creates positive experiences that open worlds, inside and out. You don’t need cannabis to discover stuff about yourself or anything else, but I do believe it helps.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy lofty goal I suppose is to help people to find their magic. Their peace. Their poetry. A renewed connection to the moment. A deeper connection to the people and places and activities they love. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe joy of discovery is one of the most fun things about being alive, with or without cannabis. With purposeful consumption, people can feel free from stress and anxiety, free from pain, focused, connected, and fully present. This creates the conditions to feel the joy of discovery more often, in any small, medium, large, silly, heart-opening, or worldview expanding way today might offer.\r\n\r\n\r\nCannabis can help you marvel more at the uniqueness of a day. To dive into the always deepening worlds inside ourselves.\r\n\r\n\r\nDiscovery awaits.\r\n\r\n\r\nstrings. warm evening breeze. embrace. 9/10\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI spent most of my life wound pretty tight. High stress. Highly sensitive to other people must be thinking about me. My mind, always racing. Racing. ALWAYS racing.\r\n\r\n\r\nI honestly didn’t pay it much attention. I thought that was what it is like to be me. I was always the “smart” kid. I figured that’s what it felt like to be smart. So I suffered through it for nearly two decades of my adult life. I didn’t realize how wound up I was, until cannabis taught me how to unwind. \r\n\r\n\r\nI owe much gratitude to the way young people today talk about mental health - as though it were as common and everyday as brushing your teeth or getting a haircut. A normal part of life. Their openness has opened new worlds for me. As the conversation around mental health has evolved over the years, I’ve learned more about myself and that racing mind. \r\n\r\n\r\nTurns out: I have anxiety. \r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I realized this, the first thing I did, of course, was take a bunch of the available tests to determine exactly how much anxiety I have. Imagine that. Me, wanting to quantify it. I took all the tests I could find, and I averaged the results. Obviously. Of course.\r\n\r\n\r\nGood news for me: my anxiety is mild. Bad news: it fluctuates.\r\n\r\nLet me say this: Knowing how a mild case of anxiety feels, and how it feels when it’s at the top of one of those fluctuations, I can’t imagine (and don’t want to know) what a serious case might feel like. \r\n\r\n\r\nSo, to all the people out there with more anxiety than me - I feel for you - and I’m rooting for you. I’m hoping something in here helps, if even just a little bit. \r\n\r\n\r\nDisclaimer before I proceed: cannabis is not something you rub on your anxiety to make it go away. It doesn’t work like that. Plant medicine does not work by holding everything else constant. \r\n\r\n\r\nMy recommendation is to try all the things that might work: exercise, meditation, cognitive behavioral therapy for sure, maybe acceptance and commitment therapy, breathing tricks, deal with the things that have left a mark on you (when you’re ready), eat a good diet, do whatever else your doctor recommends. And, if you are so inclined, combine them with purposeful cannabis consumption. You might be surprised by what you discover. But also know that it doesn’t work for everyone - and that’s okay.\r\n\r\nAbout anxiety: How does any thinking and feeling person, especially a young person, NOT feel anxiety these days?\r\n\r\nWith so many concurrent crises facing a humanity that is not working together. The meanness that we’ve let invade our collective narrative. I personally can't bear to listen any more. What happened? Or, was the meanness always there and now the confederates and the greedy have Twitter? I can’t tell.\r\n\r\n\r\nI feel for the young people. This world they’re inheriting. Watching how adults act these days. No wonder teen suicide is up. The adults of the world are out of their fucking minds - and the kids know they’re going to have to deal with the consequences.\r\n\r\nI wonder how much of our collective focus on crisis is overblown, but I don’t like the math. The more you understand modern civilization the more it appears to be a bubble built with math that is unsustainable. The perpetual growth model looks fundamentally flawed. Will technology and our big brains save us? Will a brain bigger than ours save us? We will see, soon enough I suppose. Have you noticed the weather? Have you read about the state of our topsoil? How’s that aquifer beneath you? How’s everybody enjoying world war three so far? How many more species need to perish before the house of cards falls? Why aren’t we talking about our soil and our water instead of engaging in this silly contest of personalities and culture war? Why can’t we work together on the problems that need to be solved that are important to us all? Will there be sea turtles in 50 years? Will there be your grandkid?\r\n\r\n\r\nDepending on the day, it feels dark. These days, when I meet a pregnant woman, instead of issuing a previously instinctive “Congratulations!” my internal reaction has become, “Pregnant? How optimistic of you! I hope you’re right. And I hope I’m wrong.” \r\n\r\n\r\nI don’t say that out loud, though. I envy the hopeful. \r\n\r\ntoday’s news. when yesterday’s was enough. is love enough to save us, if it finds us here? 6/10\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNot to say that the world’s problems are the cause of my anxiety. \r\n\r\n\r\nI don’t know what anxiety is about for you. I can only know what it feels like from in here. My anxiety often feels like a rapid searching over of possibilities, especially remote ones, usually for the improbable things that might go wrong. Accompanied by an unhealthy focus on those unlikely and usually terrible things. This focus can have physical consequences.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe origin of anxiety, I’ve learned, was as a survival mechanism. When life was about eating and surviving and reproducing in a world full of danger, searching over possibilities for things that might go wrong could save your life (and make you or your offspring more likely to reproduce). \r\n\r\n\r\nThe ability to look into the future and imagine possibilities and look into the past and learn from it is a gift. And a curse.\r\n\r\n\r\nThen we went and stood up a little straighter and grew these big brains. Look where that’s got us.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe instinct isn’t as helpful now.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have some good news. Over the years, I believe I’ve learned to turn my anxiety into a strength. Or at least that’s what I tell myself. On most days, I’ve learned to embrace it. Maybe this is the wrong approach. But it’s my approach. And it’s working for me. I’ve made my progress through cannabis, music, movement, and nature. Borrowing things I’ve learned from meditation, flow states, and cognitive behavioral therapy.\r\n\r\n\r\nfields of flowers. three times my dose. no zooms today. 10/10\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLong before building my relationship with cannabis and music, exercise and movement was my therapy. Always outdoors. In nature. It’s my meditation. My flow state.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I’m in the mountains moving quickly through a beautiful landscape, I am at my happiest. Free from the noisy and attention-sapping world. Free from obligations. Free from interruptions. \r\n\r\n\r\nThat’s where my racing mind slows. That’s when I feel closest to myself - where the thoughts I’ve been struggling with become clearer. It’s where I try to accept who I am and laugh at how far I’ve come. I make small commitments to be better. It’s also where I try to learn not to be so hard on myself.\r\n\r\n\r\nPart of what I experience is what you now hear called the “runner’s high” - long before ever getting high using a plant, I went running to get high. When I first got cannabis right - when I found a new world inside a pack of cannabis-infused peach gummies in 2012, I realized: I can have the runner’s high at home? Or anywhere I want, without running? Sign me up. \r\n\r\n\r\nGet the runner’s high. Without the running. \r\n\r\n\r\nBut I kept running. As it turns out (for me at least) it’s in the combination of the two where the real magic happens. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe evidence now largely confirms that the runner’s high is real - and that it has many similarities to the cannabis experience. There is one difference, though, I can run 68 miles and never get too much of the runner’s high. As long as I eat and drink properly as I go. It’s never too much. Even in my abused 48 year old body I’ve walked and hiked and jogged over 4,000 miles in the last year. I can’t get enough. \r\n\r\n\r\nBut with plant-based cannabinoids, you can have too much and go past that point where your head is just right - and into places that you don’t want to be. That’s why I consume purposefully.\r\n\r\n\r\ncolorado mornings. rocks that knew dinosaurs. rocks that know me. 10/10\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI use Strava to track some of my rides and hikes and runs. I like maps. \r\n\r\n\r\nBut, for me, my outings are no longer about going faster. They used to be. That’s where Strava gets it wrong. For me, at least. Strava encourages you to be faster than your previous self. Faster than other people. You win trophies for going faster.\r\n\r\n\r\nI’ve come to know exercise better as I’ve come to know cannabis better. Exercise is not about going as fast as you can. Just as cannabis is not about getting as high as you can. Neither is about comparing yourself to others. It's about getting it just right. For you. For me, that means stopping to inspect a new flower, taking deep breaths, and experiencing the forest with every sense I can.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe right pace to feel a connection to nature and the land. To the plants. To the rocks. To my mind. My fears. The trees. My breath. The rivers.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere’s a reason why there are so many songs about rivers. \r\n\r\n\r\nfollow me down. to the riverside. meet me at the creek. 10/10\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs I move, I play games to free my mind from the racing thoughts. I count the greens I can see in the forest. I notice each until I can’t find more. Then, I begin again.\r\n\r\n\r\nI imagine time as a map extending from the front of my forehead. I imagine all my years of memories behind me. I throw my mind forward into the future as far as I can see. I pull it back into the past as far as I can remember. Then I shorten the intervals until my mind falls only into the moment. Like a basketball bouncing off both sides of the rim before falling through. \r\n\r\n\r\nI marvel at my eyes for being able to see. I marvel at the plants for expressing so many colors. I know the colors are not for me. \r\n\r\n\r\nI wonder what photosynthesis feels like. Is it as pleasurable as eating? As satisfying? What would it feel like to go out to the beach in your swimsuit and be fed by the sun? Does it feel like pizza? \r\n\r\n\r\nI’ve lost my place. The mind wanders into the future or into the past. I find another green and start counting again.\r\n\r\n\r\nprairie rose. a welcome passerby. gotta go to Costco later. 8/10\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI used to view music as a form of entertainment. I suppose it is. For me, it’s become more than that. \r\n\r\n\r\nMusic heals. I’m obviously not the first person to say that. I’m glad I know now.\r\n\r\nMusic and cannabis don’t just heal me. They taught me that I needed healing. \r\n\r\nMusic helped me discover the healing power of cannabis. Cannabis helped me discover the healing power of music. I’m grateful to both. The way they work together.\r\n\r\n\r\nThey taught me that dancing isn’t something you do to music. Dancing is what happens when you let the music move you. Music reaches into your soul through your ears and compels you to move.\r\n\r\n\r\nI’m still a shit dancer. But I care less than ever what you think about it. It’s not about you. \r\n\r\n\r\nMusic takes that fidgety, nervous, restless energy that I feel inside me and gives it a rhythm to move to, so it can take a break from having to think for itself and stand on its own two feet. Cannabis brings my nervous rhythm and the groove together and together they make peace.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I’m lucky, I meet a new song that reaches me in just the right way. When I meet such a song, we go on a journey together. Again and again. Right now, I’m traveling with a new song from Billy Strings called  Thunder. It was written by Robbie Hunter of Grateful Dead acclaim. Played live it’s a 15-25 minute song.\r\n\r\nIt’s a song that is tethered to the ground in a few key places, but otherwise is unique every time it’s played. As of this writing, and I’m not even lying, there are 33 versions of it on my phone. \r\n\r\n\r\nThis song takes me places. It winds me up. It lets me go. It takes me inside of it. Above it. Floating. It holds me gently, if I can get myself to let it.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen it lets me back down, I somehow feel that everything is going to be okay.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe depth of gratitude I feel for music can’t be put into words. It might be able to be expressed in a song. But not one I could write. \r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I can feel music - really feel it - a wave passes through me, the purpose of which can only be to strip away pain and anxiety and replace it with something beautiful - and add peace and joy to the moment and years to my life. \r\n\r\n\r\nI’m sure science could explain it - having to do with music as an intoxicant for our auditory system. I’d prefer it to remain magic.\r\n\r\n\r\nHave you ever tried listening to music so intently you can see it? What does it look like for you? \r\n\r\n\r\nnew venue. a forgotten rhythm. riverside breeze. 10/10\r\n  \r\n\r\nI’ve spent a lot of time with these thoughts that race through my head. Trying to figure out what they’re made from. Metaphor is everywhere and in everything. Words are a weak approximation for meaning. Why do the words race so fast?\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is the unit of measure of non-verbal animal thought, if not words? Do dogs think in barks and whines? Or something else? How do human babies think before they have words? (there are lots of studies and books on the latter)\r\n\r\n\r\nIs there an underlying language of the mind that we approximate through our written and spoken languages? I think yes. And it’s one of the ways I’ve learned to control my mind and my anxiety.\r\n\r\nCould a human adult, having already acquired words, think in shapes or concepts or some other medium other than words?\r\n\r\n\r\nI’ve read all the things I can find about that. Look up psycholinguistics if you’re interested in that rabbit hole. \r\n\r\n\r\nEmotions provide an easy example. They seem to be made of feelings, not words. I suppose that's why emotions are harder to communicate about - and why it can sound so beautiful when we get it right - and so ugly when we get it wrong. Next time you’re deeply engrossed and enveloped in an emotion - try to write it down. Then, close your eyes and try to picture what it feels like instead. We mean a lot more than what we say with our words.\r\n\r\n\r\nI believe that our thoughts can be made from words. But I don’t think they have to be - and underneath the words the thoughts are made from something else.\r\n\r\nOur senses are tools we’ve evolved to make sense of the world around us (and manipulate it to our advantage for survival and reproduction). I’ve learned not to trust any one of these senses too much. Science has proven in a number of ways that our conception of reality is, at best, an approximation of it. So maybe it’s in the intersection of the senses where we can learn most about the world and ourselves? Or maybe it’s in the places in between? \r\n\r\n\r\nsearching for moose. met the columbine. from before. 9/10\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI play with this idea. I’ve played with it for a long time. As I walk about, accompanied by music, aided by cannabis - I play. A 4 hour hike is a short one for me. Barely enough time to get started.\r\n\r\n\r\nI put a concept into a word. Or, I put a problem I’m trying to solve into a word. I wrap that word in its shape. I zoom out until the shape gets appropriately small. Sometimes, I laugh at how it looks from afar. Then I slowly bring it back into view. I don’t let it get too close. I regard it from another angle. I let it evolve. Move. I zoom in and investigate its sharp edges, its smooth corners. Its dimensions. What does it look like from underneath? I look for holes. I do this with my eyes open.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt ceases to look like the word it was - and it starts to become what it is.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs I gently inspect, I try not to think about what I find using words, as easy as they are to fall back to. \r\n\r\n\r\nInstead of searching over the future for the improbable things that might go wrong, I search over difficult problems to find their improbable answers. In the places where they come out.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat are these shapes made from? It’s impossible to describe. They are made of causality. Agency. Forces acting and being acted upon. Ego. Motivation. Movement. Time. \r\n\r\n\r\nThey’re not hallucinations. Those are different, also useful, and the subject of another story. That’s where the shapes get joined together in ways that might appear nonsensical, but are sometimes exactly what you need. \r\n\r\n\r\nSometimes I’ll wrap up a person in their shape. My partner. I wrap her up in her shape. I regard her from a distance. I bring her closer. I try to get inside. No, not like that. I try to see what the world looks like from inside. I think of ways that I can be a better partner.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy the way, the other thing that calms and clarifies my mind is when I am spending quality time with her, feeling her love. So it could have been “Cannabis, music, movement, nature, love, and discovery” - but the title was already long enough.\r\n\r\n\r\nwarm sun. hollandaise. that smile. 10/10\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI call this practice Directed Anxiety. Instead of letting my mind race out of control from subject to subject, words and thoughts racing, I take one at a time and I channel the searching over of possibilities into something useful and pleasurable. \r\n\r\n\r\nI find a great deal of peace by doing this. I gain a great deal of understanding. I solve problems. I make new connections. I discover.\r\n\r\n\r\nSometimes, as I’m regarding a shape, I let the music in and watch the notes bounce off. Or, I let the notes become absorbed by the shape and ricochet within. What does it feel like there? What does it sound like? How does it smell?\r\n\r\n\r\nI have a collection of such shapes for most subjects in my life. A library (of sorts). When I’m walking, I browse the shelfs. I regard the shapes as I pass by. Sometimes with love and intrigue and interest. Sometimes with contempt. Sometimes with nostalgia. We’ve spent a lot of time together.\r\n\r\n\r\nI take out one at a time. Or do I allow it in? It’s hard to tell. I never intentionally examine more than one at a time. Not on purpose. But it’s when I realize how two are connected that I discover something new.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy favorite thing to do lately is start with an empty shape and see what it becomes. To create something new. These shapes are the hardest to put into words. Because they didn’t begin that way. I’ve been thinking about trying to learn to draw.\r\n\r\n\r\nlight evening rain. lifts the waking prairie. a hopping meadowlark. 9/10.\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSometimes, I can’t do it. I’m distracted. The world is too loud.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy nemesis is future conversations that I need to have. They invade. Uninvited. They create a rush of unwelcome noise between me and my thoughts. A busy freeway between me and peace.\r\n\r\n\r\nCannabis brings me right back to the moment. So do the greens. So does the song. I’ve learned not to force it. \r\n\r\n\r\nWe forget (or at least I do at times) that we can think about whatever you want. How often do we let others dictate our agenda? How often does the next notification decide for us? I’ve worked hard to take my attention back. Back from this noise of the busy world. Back from the noise inside my head. I do it better with cannabis. I do it best while walking. \r\n\r\n\r\nMy anxiety is now a toy I play with instead of a glitch that consumes me. It does still win sometimes, but I know exactly what to do. And I go for a walk.\r\n\r\n\r\nSometimes, I find that a shape can be split in two. I was wrong to behold it as one. Sometimes a little chunk falls off unexpectedly. I catch it and wonder why.\r\n\r\n\r\nI find some subjects that can’t be contained. There are some things so fascinating and complex that they seem unable to be contained. Those are my favorites. \r\n\r\n\r\nOften, it’s one of the subjects I’m studying or learning about. Geology. Mantle convection. Every rock, river, and mountain has a story to tell. I want to hear their hidden tales. Lichens. Have you ever tried to understand lichens? Two genetically distinct species that join forces to survive in environments in which neither could survive alone. They have lessons to teach. The more you learn the crazier it gets. It's early days on that subject for me. You can’t understand lichens until you get a little botany and mycology. \r\n\r\n\r\nLearning also calms my mind. It’s fun to see how far I can get before the subject turns to math.\r\n\r\n\r\nalways. clearer. up here. 10/10\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHave you ever stood on one of those places on the coast where large boulders meet the water? Sometimes naturally. Sometimes knocked down from the road construction above. \r\n\r\n\r\nAs I walk, I imagine myself as that place where the water meets the rocks. Sometimes gently lapping. Other times crashing violently. Always there together. I try to get to know the rocks. The places and times they came from. I let the rocks get to know me. I look down on them from above. I feel the deepness beneath the rocks and wonder. I feel the emptiness. I see glimpses of clarity.\r\n\r\n\r\nThen, I hear the music crashing into the rocks with me and I realize that Thunder started 14 minutes ago. I should start it over and try to stay with the song - and see where it takes me next.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe world reveals itself to us through metaphors. It also hides behind them.\r\n\r\n\r\nlistening for the silence. listening to the trees. 9/10\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI find that the more I understand a thing, the more beautiful it becomes. The more I realize how much more there is to know. And how much can never be known.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I emerge from one of these places, I feel like not only am I emerging out of the geographic and physical space I was in, but also emerging from the other places I went. \r\n\r\n\r\nRenewed.\r\n\r\n\r\nIs it the music or the cannabis or nature or the movement or the experience that brings me to this better place? \r\n\r\n\r\nI think it’s all of them, working together.\r\n\r\n\r\nProperty of David Kooi and Skylark Creations LLC.

    "content": "The Goals for Your Cannabis Consumption\r\nIt's about living better\r\n\r\nDAVID KOOI\r\n\r\nIn the ever-evolving landscape of cannabis, understanding why we consume is as crucial as how we consume. At Jointly, we've spent the last five years meticulously tracking cannabis consumption and unearthing the real reasons behind it.\r\n\r\nWhat does the data reveal? Cannabis consumption transcends the archaic notion of merely 'getting high.' It’s about enhancing life's quality through purposeful consumption, a notion echoed in our unique data on which products best serve these purposes.\r\n\r\nThanks for reading Cannabis Uncaged! Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support my work.\r\n\r\n\r\nSubscribed\r\n\r\nThe Power of Purposeful Goals\r\n\r\nIn the nearly five years since the launch of our Jointly mobile app, hundreds of thousands of consumers across the country have used our app to say, “THIS is why I consume cannabis” — and then get better at it. We have persistently inquired about their reasons for consumption, seeking to understand their specific intentions. From this repetitive and detailed querying, we have formulated our 12 distinct goals, each directly informed by the feedback and data provided by our users.\r\n\r\nThe 12 goals driving cannabis consumption each reflect a deep, often unspoken, human desire to improve one's state of being. The purposeful consumption of cannabis for these goals represent real, positive transformations in everyday lives:\r\n\r\n1. Relax & Refresh (36%) - Cannabis provides a haven for relaxation and rejuvenation.\r\n\r\n2. Relieve Everyday Stress (35%) - The embrace of cannabis eases the tension of daily life, offering a calm escape.\r\n\r\n3. Improve Sleep (26%) - A remedy for the restless, cannabis aids in the pursuit of peaceful, restorative sleep.\r\n\r\n4. Energize & Uplift (32%) - Defying lethargy, cannabis serves as a catalyst for energy and positivity.\r\n\r\n5. Ease Everyday Pain (25%) - Cannabis stands as a gentle aid against the discomforts that ail us in our daily lives.\r\n\r\n6. Enjoy Social Experiences (27%) - It enhances social interactions, making gatherings more enjoyable and connected.\r\n\r\n7. Focus (20%) - Aiding concentration, cannabis can be a tool for clarity and attentiveness.\r\n\r\n8. Create (18%) - Unleashing creativity, it serves as a muse for artists and thinkers alike.\r\n\r\n9. Stimulate Appetite (19%) - For those struggling with appetite, cannabis rekindles the joy of eating.\r\n\r\n10. Enhance Intimacy (16%) - It deepens connections, adding a layer of intensity and closeness to relationships.\r\n\r\n11. Exercise (15%) - Cannabis plays a role in enhancing physical activity \r\n\r\n12. Recover From Exercise (10%) - It also aids in post-exercise recovery.\r\n\r\nNote: The parenthetical percentages above reflect the incidence of people choosing that goal. Cannabis consumers, on average, have 2.4 goals for their consumption. All indications are that this number will increase with widening acceptance and education. \r\n\r\nThese 12 goals are also fairly comprehensive. When we poll consumers and ask them why they consume cannabis and provide these 12 choices plus an ‘other’ - less than 2% choose ‘other.’\r\n\r\nWhat Qualifies as a Goal?\r\n\r\nTo qualify as a goal, a potential goal needs to satisfy a “yes” answer to these questions:\r\n1. Is this a distinct reason why people use cannabis?\r\n2. Is it phrased in a positive way such that more of it is generally a good thing?\r\n3. Does cannabis product performance vary, based on different formulations of cannabinoids and terpenes, for that goal?\r\n4. Is the goal not a medical condition? (the laws of the land do not permit this)\r\n\r\nBeyond 'Getting High': A Deeper Understanding\r\n\r\nSome people will retort, “What if my goal is just to get high?” The quest to 'get high' is often misunderstood. At Jointly, we believe ‘getting high” is not a goal in itself but a gateway to deeper, more meaningful objectives. People don't just seek THC for its sake; they seek the experiences and states of being that THC can facilitate. These experiences align with our 12 goals, shaping a more structured and purposeful journey with cannabis, and leading to better outcomes.\r\n\r\nA Challenge to the Cannabis Industry\r\n\r\nTo cannabis retailers: How many of the diverse consumption goals are your budtenders actively addressing in their sales approach? When a customer walks into your store, your budtenders are not just selling cannabis products; they are providing solutions to a wide range of consumer needs and desires. It's essential to understand and embrace the variety of goals that drive customers to your store. The effectiveness of your sales strategy hinges on how well your team can match each customer with products that align with their specific consumption goals. This approach doesn't just drive sales; it builds trust, loyalty, and a deeper understanding of the holistic value your products offer to the consumer's life.\r\n\r\nTo cannabis growers and manufacturers: How well do you tailor your products to the reasons people consume? Our data shows a clear customer preference – 80% performance, 20% flavor/aroma. People yearn for effective solutions to their goals, even if it means compromising on taste or scent. Your focus should be on creating products that not only meet these goals but also surpass competitors in goal-specific performance.\r\n\r\nEducating Consumers and Shaping the Future\r\n\r\nOur goals serve not just as a guide but as an educational tool. How many people truly understand the breadth of reasons to consume cannabis? By showcasing these 12 goals, we're opening eyes to the myriad ways cannabis can positively impact lives. \r\n\r\nIn Conclusion\r\n\r\nAs we consider expanding our goals – possibly adding 'Suppress Appetite' or splitting 'Exercise' into ‘Exercise Enjoyment’ and ‘Exercise Performance’ – we stay committed to evolving alongside consumer needs. Given the nature of our times, I’ve long advocated for ‘Relieve Existential Dread’ as a goal, but have yet to convince the Jointly team. \r\n\r\nThanks for reading. I’m proud to stand with Jointly at the forefront of a revolution in cannabis consumption, where purpose, not just potency, guides our choices. Our message is clear: Embrace the goals, embrace purposeful consumption, and watch as the landscape of cannabis transforms for the better.",

Consumers can engage with the tool in two ways: They can follow a guided experience or ask questions in their own natural language, whether written or spoken. The Virtual Budtender then taps into Jointly’s proprietary algorithm, which is fueled by real-world evidence gathered from hundreds of thousands of consumers’ cannabis reflections logged on the Jointly app since 2020.\r\nEvery day, new user reflections and feedback are added to the platform, ensuring the AI’s product recommendations are continuously refined and improved. \r\n“With every reflection a user logs, our recommendations get better,” said David Kooi, CEO of Jointly. “This is a living, breathing database that grows with every experience shared on our app, and the result is unmatched accuracy in helping consumers reach their goals.”\r\nJointly’s platform has more product ratings than Weedmaps and Leafly combined, but that’s not the only edge. Where those platforms rely on general ratings, Jointly’s ratings are goal-specific, allowing the Virtual Budtender to offer the most precise recommendations based on individual needs—whether that’s relaxing, improving sleep or enhancing creativity.\r\n“What sets our Virtual Budtender apart is that it’s powered by the only database in the industry that ties cannabis products to real-world consumer experiences,” Kooi added. “This is not about generic AI responses or basic product information. This is a truly personalized recommendation engine that uses data to make intelligent, goal-specific suggestions based on what actually works for people.”\r\nWhere other AI tools may simply rely on certificate of analysis (COA) data—which tells consumers what’s in the product but not how it will perform—Jointly’s Virtual Budtender delivers more reliable recommendations by factoring in real-world outcomes.[g] [h][i]The Virtual Budtender enables retailers to play a crucial role in solving the complexity of cannabis shopping. By providing answers to questions on everything from safe dosing and best practices to store hours and delivery zones, the AI tool helps retailers enhance the shopping experience and improve customer satisfaction—increasing conversion rates and average cart value. Retailers can even customize the AI to reflect their unique brand voice and values.\r\n“[j]The Virtual Budtender is a game-changer for us,” said Ruben Seyde[k][l], Founder and CEO of Delivered Inc., a premier Massachusetts cannabis delivery dispensary. “It allows us to provide personalized, reliable guidance to our customers around the clock. Our staff can focus on delivering orders, while the AI handles routine inquiries and ensures that customers always have the support they need—even at 2 a.m. What makes it even better is that it's backed by real-world data, not just chemistry.”\r\nAt the heart of this innovation is the consumer. The Virtual Budtender gives cannabis shoppers the personalized guidance they’ve always needed. Consumers can confidently select the products that best match their goals and preferences, knowing that recommendations are driven by real evidence, not just AI speculation or COA details. Whether they’re exploring cannabis for the first time or looking to refine their experience, they can trust that their choices are supported by data and expert advice from over 300 medically reviewed, research-based articles on Jointly’s platform.\r\nConsumers and retailers alike can experience the Virtual Budtender in action on Delivered Inc.’s website, and learn more about Jointly’s retail solutions here, which are now used by almost 50 retailers nationwide[m][n].[o][p][q][r][s] \r\nFor more information about Jointly and its mission to enhance lives through purposeful cannabis consumption, visit Jointly’s website.\r\nAbout Jointly\r\nJointly is a forward-thinking cannabis software company committed to helping people enhance their lives through purposeful consumption. At the forefront of the cannabis industry's evolution toward more personalized shopping and informed, empowered consumers, Jointly’s discovery platform enables both consumers and retailers to make smarter, more informed choices through data-driven insights.

Discover how to get more out of cannabis at jointlybetter.com.\r\n\r\n\r\nMedia Contact: \r\nBreanna Lopresti\r\nGrasslands: A Journalism-Minded Agency\r\nBreanna@mygrasslands.com \r\n\r\n\r\n[a]Made suggested edits to tighten (definitely need to consider the subheadings, 30 words right there)\r\n[b]Awesome work thank you. After resolving and accepting the comments and edits, we're down to 750ish.\r\n[c]Eric suggests \"Amplify\" here? Also could consider \"Revolutionize\" and the like - but that word seems beaten to meaninglessness in press releases.\r\n[d]Maybe we can incorporate a stat in the title or in the first paragraph to give some 'need to have' around a tool like ours? Examples from https://fitsmallbusiness.com/online-shopping-statistics/: \r\nNearly 60% of consumers prefer to shop online\r\nConsumers believe AI will improve their online shopping experience\r\nA hybrid online and in-person shopping approach is becoming the mainstream approach\r\n[e]Initial reaction: With the underlying fears about AI taking human jobs away, should the headline lead with \"empowering retailers\"? Offering a couple of ideas that shifts the focus to consumers\r\n[f]Good point. I like your 2nd one. \"Jointly Taps Powerful Database of Real-World Insights to Transform Cannabis Retail and Empower Consumers\" but will also collect a few other opinions.\r\n[g]Take or leave, because this may add more copy to the release that's not needed, but if we wanted to take a slight jab at the other \"AI recommenders\" out there (and prove the need for ours that is accurate and trusted), we can add this: \r\nOnly 21% of brands are currently using AI tools (Concerns about inaccurate recommendations (51%), misinformation (45%), and data privacy breaches (40%) plague AI adoption in e-commerce.)\r\nFrom: https://fitsmallbusiness.com/online-shopping-statistics/\r\n[h]Re: Lauren's \"take it or leave it note\" about retailers slow to adopt AI for various reasons -- it made me wonder how Jointly is preventing product brands from trashing their competitors with cannabis reflections that \"this product didn't work at all\" or disgruntled ex-employee trolling\r\n[i]We have algorithmic solutions to this that prevent any one person's opinion from influencing the results too greatly for any one product or brand. For example, if a person rates something poorly once, that's one thing. If they rate the same product poorly over and over again - then why do they keep using that product you're being weird - each reflection in our app is a about a separate cannabis session (so we exclude it, especially if not enough time elapses between ratings). But if multiple people in multiple places rate a thing poorly once - then it is more likely to be actually bad. This could be done via a grand conspiracy, but is unlikely. To date we haven't seen a lot of evidence of people trying to do this on Jointly - but we've seen some and we monitor it closely.\r\n[j]1 total reaction\r\nLauren McGurn reacted with ❤️ at 2024-10-08 06:33 AM\r\n[k]Note: I have not yet gotten permission from Ruben for this quotation. I am certain he'll be down to be included - but I want to give him a chance to edit his contribution.\r\n[l]@breanna@mygrasslands.com @laurenmcgurn@jointlybetter.com Ruben has approved his quotation so we're good to go there. He made a couple of small edits that I accepted, but kept the gist of it the same.\r\n[m]@breanna@mygrasslands.com @laurenmcgurn@jointlybetter.com In reference to the subject of publishing now vs waiting for wider acceptance - my inclination is to publish ASAP. We can always do another one later.\r\n[n]I added this ending to this sentence. We don't have 50 virtual budtenders active. We have 3 (and dozens more coming). But we do have almost 50 using the Jointly platform in one way or another now.\r\n[o]Maybe this is a question for Grasslands, but would it be more impactful to hold on this release until we have a few more stores across the US so we can add a sentence or two (at the beginning of the release) that \"just launched, and already on XX dispensary websites across X states.\" (Or even initial data/stats that could be compelling?) - I know the strength of selling for other plug-ins has been that retailers see other dispensaries jumping on board and they don't want to get left behind. By just talking about Delivered Inc and not noting our broader interest/sales, it may seem small and inconsequential.\r\n[p]In our cision plan, we have 1 national release left, expiring at the end of Feb 2025.\r\n[q]We love Lauren's thought on showing further retail interest / implementation with a concrete stat in the lede -- it would add timeliness and sense of urgency.\r\n[r]@breanna@mygrasslands.com - thoughts on including an image with this release? It's an extra cost, and would love to get your team's perspective on the value of including an image. Thanks!\r\n[s]What sort of image were you thinking?",

    "content": "Habitual vs Intentional vs Purposeful Cannabis Consumption\r\nDifferent approaches\r\n\r\nDAVID KOOI\r\n\r\nAs an advocate for the transformative potential of cannabis, I’ve always emphasized the importance of purposeful cannabis consumption. A common question I encounter is about the difference between “intentional” and “purposeful” consumption, and I believe it's equally important to understand how these differ from “habitual” consumption.\r\n\r\nBefore we dive in, I want to emphasize that there is no universally 'right' or 'wrong' way to consume cannabis. The diversity in consumption methods and practices reflects the individuality of consumers and their unique needs. If someone is using cannabis in a way that enhances their life and brings them benefits, then more power to them. The key is that the use of cannabis should contribute positively to one's life, whether it aligns with purposeful, intentional, or habitual consumption patterns. \r\n\r\nHabitual Consumption\r\n\r\nDefinition: Habitual consumption refers to the regular use of cannabis as part of a routine, often lacking a conscious reason or specific intent for each use. This automatic nature means consumption becomes a part of one's daily or regular habits.\r\n\r\nFocus: The focus here is often on the act of consuming as part of a routine. Unlike the deliberate mindfulness of intentional consumption or the goal-oriented approach of purposeful consumption, habitual consumption emphasizes comfort and familiarity of routine rather than specific outcomes or reasons.\r\n\r\nScope: Habitual consumption might mean using cannabis as part of a daily routine, without actively considering the reasons for each use or the outcomes it produces. This type lacks the element of conscious choice central to both intentional and purposeful consumption.\r\n\r\nIntentional Consumption\r\n\r\nIntentional cannabis consumption is a fundamental component of a purposeful approach. It signifies a basic level of conscious decision-making in using cannabis, whether for relaxation, pain relief, or other reasons. Intentional use is a crucial first step in a journey towards a more informed and effective cannabis experience. It represents the user's choice to consume cannabis with a specific goal in mind. \r\n\r\nDefinition: Intentional consumption is the act of consuming cannabis with a clear and conscious reason, where every action is deliberate and stems from a specific intent. \r\n\r\nFocus: The emphasis is on the conscious choice behind the consumption. It's about being aware of what you're consuming and why.\r\n\r\nScope: Intentional consumption means using cannabis with a clear understanding of the reasons for its use.\r\n\r\n\r\nSubscribed\r\n\r\nPurposeful Consumption\r\n\r\nPurposeful cannabis consumption, as defined in the Theory of Purposeful Cannabis Consumption, is a more sophisticated model and framework. It incorporates intentional use but adds layers of experimentation and reflection, creating a cycle of continuous learning and improvement. This approach involves not just choosing cannabis with a purpose but also understanding the myriad of factors that influence its effectiveness. It's about selecting the right product, dosage, and consumption method, considering the individual’s physiology, and being mindful of the context in which cannabis is used.\r\n\r\nExperimentation and reflection are central to this approach. Purposeful consumption encourages users to try different products and methods, reflecting on each experience to understand what works best for them. This process is supported by data and evidence, making it the most reliable path to finding the most effective cannabis solutions for individual needs.\r\n\r\nPurposeful consumption is a concept that has evolved significantly over the years, incorporating elements of intentional use but transcending them to reach a more nuanced and effective approach. \r\n\r\nDefinition: Purposeful consumption involves consuming cannabis with a defined goal or purpose in mind, directed towards achieving a specific outcome or benefit.\r\n\r\nFocus: The emphasis is on the desired outcome or benefit of the consumption. It's about aligning the act of consuming cannabis with a particular goal or set of goals.\r\n\r\nScope: Purposeful consumption means using cannabis to achieve specific goals or benefits, like better sleep, reduced anxiety, or increased creativity. \r\n\r\nAt Jointly, we facilitate this process through our platform, harnessing the power of user-generated data. Our users share their experiences, providing insights into how various cannabis products perform for specific goals. This data forms the backbone of our purposeful consumption model, offering a real-world, evidence-based guide to cannabis consumption.\r\n\r\nThe role of Spark AI is becoming pivotal. As an AI tool developed by Jointly, it leverages our extensive database to provide personalized recommendations to users, analyzing data from hundreds of thousands of user experiences.\r\n\r\nOur goal at Jointly is to support and empower each individual's journey with cannabis, celebrating the positive impact it can have in various forms.\r\n\r\nThe journey from habitual to intentional to purposeful cannabis consumption is an evolution from a basic understanding of cannabis's potential to a sophisticated, data-informed approach. It’s a journey that Jointly is proud to facilitate, through our commitment to data, innovation, and the empowering potential of cannabis. Purposeful consumption, underpinned by experimentation, reflection, and intelligent use of technology like Spark AI, represents the future of cannabis use – a future where cannabis is not just used but used well, with profound benefits for individuals and society as a whole.",

    "content": "﻿• Where you grew up, and where you live now.\r\nI grew up in Chicago, lived in Southern California for about 20 years, and recently moved to the Denver area.\r\n\r\n\r\n• Your current role in the cannabis industry, and where you're based.\r\nI am the CEO and co-founder of Jointly, the cannabis wellness company. We’re a fully remote company and I am based near Denver.\r\n\r\n• A story about the positive impact cannabis has had on your life.\r\nMy life is better because cannabis is in it. Cannabis has opened new worlds for me, inside and out. It enhances my favorite experiences. Music, hiking, and writing. It calms my busy mind and enables me to focus and think more clearly. With the right dose, it stimulates my creativity and helps me draw together previously unrelated topics to find new truths. It helps me manage my anxiety. I sleep better. I enjoy a deeper connection to moments, people, and places. The positive impact cannabis has had on me is why I started Jointly. Most cannabis consumers know that cannabis makes their life better. Now we’re proving it, with data. We just published “The Theory of Purposeful Cannabis Consumption” <insert link when available> in which we use a combination of Jointly’s data and outside data to prove that cannabis, consumed purposefully, makes you more - not less. Ending the stigma. Mathematically, at least.\r\n\r\n\r\n• A favorite flower, edible, product, or brand.\r\nI am currently exploring edible products with a 1:1 THC:CBG ratio for energizing, focusing, and stimulating creativity, while I prefer products with THC and CBD (usually with the CBD in a higher proportion) for relaxation and stress relief, and to help keep me off the dad Skittles (Advil) to recover from exercise - and to recover from working at a computer for most of the day. Jointly is an unbiased platform where people can find the best brands and products for them, so I don’t like to express my personal brand or product preferences. The right products for me might be the wrong products for you, depending on your goals and your unique endocannabinoid system. \r\n\r\n\r\n• The biggest challenge cannabis marketers face today.\r\nCannabis is misunderstood. Most consumers don’t know that:\r\n1. Cannabis is a complex plant that produces a variety of effects\r\n2. People use cannabis for many different productive purposes\r\n3. Cannabis affects each person differently\r\n4. People realize their goals more often when they create the conditions for a good experience\r\nUntil the consumer learns and internalizes these truths, and discards the stigma that has taught too many people that cannabis makes them less, not more - cannabis marketers will be navigating into strong headwinds. And, of course, the social media restrictions are annoying and unfair and (again) rooted in the stigma. How do you reach people when you can’t meet them where they are? Most people are on social media.\r\n\r\n\r\n• One thing you're excited about right now in cannabis branding, partnerships or marketing.\r\nI see more and more brands selling their products by emphasizing the effects they will have on the consumer. Products specifically formulated and marketed to energize, uplift, improve sleep, improve focus. We call it purposeful consumption. Consumers already consume  purposefully. It’s not about getting high. It’s about living better. I’m excited to see brands emerging from the past that was rooted in strains, strain types, cannabinoids, and terpenes - and focus on the kind of experience their products provide. Market and sell based on the reasons why people consume - not the ingredients. If we can make cannabis easier, more people will get to enjoy its benefits.\r\n\r\n\r\n• A cannabis trade/social justice organization that you support and why.\r\nI admire NORML’s history, consistency, and dedication to reforming the laws that govern cannabis production and consumption. They’ve been on the right side of history since their founding in 1970, while a large part of the rest of the country was busy stigmatizing cannabis and putting producers and consumers in jail and firing them from jobs. I’m happy that we now have the data to prove that NORML was right all along.\r\n\r\n• A project you worked on recently that you're proud of, and why.\r\nJointly recently became the first company to include reimbursement for legal cannabis consumption as part of our company wellness benefit. I’m proud of this because it’s one of my missions to create a new conversation about cannabis wellness, and with this action we’re elevating cannabis to its proper place among exercise, meditation, massage, a good diet, and proper hydration - as a tool for finding new pathways to wellbeing.\r\n\r\n\r\n• Someone else's project you admired recently, and why.\r\nI really admire what Max Simon and the folks at Green Flower have done with their Ganjier program. The job of the budtender is so vital and the difficulty of performing that job well is undervalued and underappreciated. We ask budtenders to be therapists, pharmacists, psychologists, educators, merchandisers, plant biologists, sales people, promoters of brands, and friends to the consumer. I support all efforts to elevate their role in the industry and help make their jobs easier.\r\n\r\n\r\n• Someone you admire in cannabis who's doing great things, and why.\r\nA tough one. There are so many great people doing great things in cannabis. I’ll generalize and say that I admire the cannabis retailer. Retail is tough. It’s hard to get a license. It’s hard to market your business and get the word out. It’s hard to hire good employees. It’s hard to educate a skeptical and cautious public. It’s hard to sort through the thousands of brands and products to find the ones you should stock in your store. Once in your store, it’s hard to connect people to products. Taxes are too high. Competition from unlicensed stores and sellers is strong, and unfair. They are forced to fight on an unfair playing field, yet I go into so many cannabis retailers these days and find people dedicated to their mission. Fighting the good fight. Helping people, one customer at a time, discover the better life that is possible with cannabis.\r\n\r\n\r\n• What you'd be doing if you weren't in the cannabis industry.\r\nI work in cannabis because I love cannabis. I believe that cannabis legalization and normalization is a tremendous opportunity to improve our collective wellbeing. Previously, I worked in bicycle retail because I loved bicycles. Who is not happy when they get a new bike? When is it not a good time for a bike ride? So, if not cannabis, I’d probably be doing something else I love and trying to find a way to have a positive impact on that subject, too. What else do I love…Music? Plants? Mushrooms? Hiking? Trees? Save for later. It’s cannabis, for now.",

Before we dive in, our readers would love to learn a bit more about you. Can you tell us a bit about your childhood backstory and how you grew up? \r\n\r\n\r\nI had a great childhood. I miss it. I was fortunate to grow up in suburban Chicago in the 80s and 90s. We rode bikes. Played baseball in the streets. Played kickball in the schoolyard. Played pickup games of all kinds at the park. We collected and traded baseball cards. I had great teachers and parents. I was very lucky.\r\n\r\n\r\nI had a lot of fun jobs growing up, too. I worked at the snack bar at the local pool. I caddied at a local country club. I worked in a factory that made conveyor systems. I worked at Blockbuster Video during its heyday. Those early jobs shaped my childhood and taught me a lot.\r\n \r\nCan you share the most interesting story that happened to you since you began your career?\r\n \r\nWith so many twists and turns it’s hard to pick one. This current chapter in my career began with a package of THC-infused peach gummies. I suppose that’s an interesting story. You know how in the Chronicles of Narnia, the protagonists find a magical portal to a new world inside a wardrobe? Well, a little over 10 years ago I discovered a new world inside that package of gummies. It’s what’s brought me here today.\r\n\r\n\r\nNone of us are able to achieve success without some help along the way. Is there a particular person who you are grateful towards who helped get you to where you are? Can you share a story about that?\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are a lot of people to whom I owe a debt of gratitude for helping me along the way. The first person who comes to my mind now is my partner in Jointly, Eric Gutshall. Eric and I have been friends for almost 20 years after working together in a previous job. Eric helped me choose and secure the location for my last business before this one. At Jointly, Eric has helped create an environment where we can focus on what matters and build something unique, useful, and valuable. \r\n \r\nCan you please give us your favorite  \"Life Lesson Quote\"? Can you share how that was relevant to you in your life?\r\n\r\n\r\nHmmmm… I usually turn to Kurt Vonnegut when I’m in need of some timeless wisdom. Kurt wrote:\r\n\r\n\r\n“I want to stand as close to the edge as I can without going over. Out on the edge you can see all kinds of things you can’t see from the center.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThis quote has always resonated with me. If you don’t explore the edges, you’ll never go anywhere new. \r\n\r\n\r\nOk super. Let’s now shift to the main part of our discussion about the tech tools that you are helping to create that can make a positive impact on our wellness. To begin, which particular problems are you aiming to solve?\r\n\r\n\r\nAt Jointly, we believe in purposeful cannabis consumption. Jointly is here to make cannabis perform better for you. We believe that your life can be better with cannabis in it. And we’re here to help. \r\n\r\n\r\nCannabis can help you relax, relieve stress, sleep better, manage pain, improve focus and enhance creativity. It can be an integral part of a healthy lifestyle.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut the modern cannabis consumer faces a lot of hurdles.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen there are thousands of new products coming to market, how do you know which ones to choose? When cannabis can be used for so many different purposes, how do you know which products are right for your purposes? How do you know which products are most effective at their promised benefits? \r\n\r\n\r\nExisting cannabis product ratings are not goal specific. That makes them less helpful. The right product to help you sleep is likely the wrong one to help you enjoy a social situation. The right product to ease your pain is likely the wrong one to stimulate your creativity.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe know that cannabis can affect each person differently, too. Once you’ve chosen a product, the results you get can be inconsistent. The same product and dose on one day might feel just right. The next day it doesn’t seem to work. The day after that it seems like your dose was too high. How do you learn to get the results you want every time?\r\n \r\nHow do you think your technology can address this? \r\n\r\n\r\nJointly solves these problems. Here’s how: \r\n\r\n\r\nOn Jointly’s proprietary data platform, tens of thousands of cannabis wellness enthusiasts are tracking their experiences to improve their results. While they track those experiences, they create our unbiased and authentic goal-specific cannabis product ratings – ratings specific to the reasons why people use cannabis: to sleep better, to relax, to manage pain, to focus or stimulate their creativity.\r\n\r\n\r\nThose product ratings are setting the legal cannabis industry’s first experience-based standard for product performance, taste, and aroma. \r\n\r\n\r\nUsing those ratings, you (and all consumers) can identify the products most likely to work for your own wellness goals. \r\n\r\n\r\nThen, you (and all consumers) can also use our free mobile app to learn to enjoy your ideal cannabis experience every time by tracking and optimizing the 15 factors that can impact your results.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can think of the 15 factors as falling into 4 categories\r\n1) Your purpose\r\n2) The product \r\n3) Your methods – for example: dose, time between doses, ingestion method, whether your stomach is full or empty\r\n4) Your lifestyle factors – for example: the sleep you get, how hydrated you are, the quality of your diet, and the setting in which you enjoy your cannabis .\r\n\r\n\r\nAll of those factors can and do impact your experience. Jointly helps you dial them in to get the results you want.\r\n\r\n\r\nCan you tell us the backstory about what inspired you to originally feel passionate about this cause?\r\n \r\nThe story of Jointly, despite its origin as an iPhone app, begins thousands of years ago when the benefits of cannabis were first discovered by early human societies. \r\n\r\n\r\nIn an alternate reality, folk knowledge and wisdom might have led to modern scientific research that allowed us to harness the potential of cannabis. In that world, consumers would enjoy a shared understanding of healthy, natural, purposeful, plant-based wellness. That world might not need Jointly.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this reality, the United States and most of the rest of the world engaged in a decades-long prohibition of cannabis use and research. This has forced millions to endure pain, stress, and anxiety that cannabis could have easily and naturally relieved. Prohibition has put people in jail who shouldn’t be in jail. Prohibition has forced people to turn to the illegal market for their medicine. We’ve lost our cultural knowledge of its benefits. Jointly is here to help people re-discover this knowledge.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow do you think this might change the world?\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are over 50 million Americans suffering from chronic pain today. We want to help them realize that their life could be better with cannabis in it. Jointly can help accomplish this.\r\n \r\nKeeping “Black Mirror” and the “Law of Unintended Consequences” in mind, can you see any potential drawbacks about this technology that people should think more deeply about?\r\n\r\n\r\nIt’s always possible to have too much of a good thing. That’s why Jointly is about safe and purposeful consumption. For example, Jointly can help you find your minimum effective dose. Jointly can also help you identify and mitigate any unwanted side effects.\r\n \r\nHere is the main question for our discussion. Based on your experience and success, can you please share “Five things you need to know to successfully create technology that can make a positive social impact”?  (Please share a story or an example, for each.) \r\n\r\n\r\n1. Listen to and understand your customers. What do they want? What problems do  they face? What obstacles stand between them and the better life they want? At Jointly, we know that it’s not about “getting high.” It’s about managing pain or stress. It’s about stimulating creativity, unplugging from a long day. \r\n\r\n\r\n2. Be authentic and unbiased. At Jointly, you can rely on us for the most dependable ratings and recommendations. No brand can pay for a better rating or better placement on our platform.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Be useful. Jointly empowers consumers with the tools and information they need to consume cannabis safely and with purpose. \r\n\r\n\r\n4. Help your customers on their journey. Show them a path. Understand that your business or technology is not the star of the show. You customer is. Guide them. We are here to help consumers discover purposeful cannabis consumption so that they can live better, naturally.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. Make sure your technology is a delight to use. Do user testing. Do A/B testing. Iterate. Be willing to explore harsh realities, including your own weaknesses. \r\n\r\n\r\nIf you could tell other young people one thing about why they should consider making a positive impact on our environment or society, like you, what would you tell them?\r\n\r\n\r\nFor this one I’ll borrow from Dr. Seuss, “Unless someone like you cares a whole awful lot, nothing is going to get better. It’s not.”\r\n\r\n\r\nIs there a person in the world, or in the US with whom you would like to have a private breakfast or lunch, and why? He or she might just see this, especially if we tag them. :-)\r\n\r\n\r\nAre we allowed to get high at breakfast and stay for lunch? I’d pick David Byrne. I find his mind and his music to be endlessly fascinating. Plus, he loves cycling as much as I do, so we can head out for a ride before lunch.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow can our readers further follow your work online?\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can check out our website, jointlybetter.com, for additional information and download our app for free on Apple / Google.\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you so much for joining us. This was very inspirational, and we wish you continued success in your important work.  \r\n \r\nThank you. Bye.",

At Jointly, we're at the forefront of this revolution, leveraging unique, organic, unbiased data and cutting-edge algorithms to transform how cannabis products are matched with consumers' unique preferences and needs. It's about enhancing the cannabis journey for consumers, budtenders, and retailers alike.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Essence of Our Algorithm\r\n\r\n\r\nImagine a world where every cannabis product you encounter is precisely aligned with your desired experience. That's the reality Jointly's product matching algorithm seeks to create. By analyzing the vast and varied reasons people turn to cannabis—from relaxation and stress relief to creativity and social enjoyment—we've distilled these motivations into 12 core goals:\r\n\r\n\r\nRelax & Refresh\r\nRelieve Everyday Stress\r\nImprove Sleep\r\nEnergize & Uplift\r\nEase Everyday Pain\r\nEnjoy Social Experiences\r\nFocus\r\nCreate\r\nStimulate Appetite\r\nEnhance Intimacy\r\nExercise\r\nRecover From Exercise\r\n\r\n\r\nThese goals encompass 98% of cannabis use cases, ensuring our algorithm speaks directly to consumer needs.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow It Works: The Math Behind the Match\r\n\r\n\r\nOur algorithm begins with a humble assumption: every new product is, on average, average. It might sound harsh, but it's a statistical reality that sets the stage for unbiased evaluation. The algorithm then continues with a deep analysis of product characteristics like product type, strain, cannabinoid content, and terpenes - the impact of each being informed by real user experiences. \r\n\r\n\r\nAs products gather user ratings, our algorithm dynamically adjusts its expectations, considering both the quantity and consistency of feedback. This isn't a static system; it's a living, breathing model that evolves with each new data point, ensuring recommendations are always current and accurate.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Data Driving Innovation\r\n\r\n\r\nOur algorithm's intelligence is fueled by authentic, goal-specific reflections from hundreds of thousands of cannabis enthusiasts, recorded in the Jointly app since 2020. This rich dataset is the backbone of our recommendations, ensuring they're grounded in real-world experiences rather than conjecture, marketing hype, outdated anecdotal evidence, and vague references to chemistry.\r\n\r\n\r\nJointly's AI: Personalization at Its Best\r\n\r\n\r\nWith the introduction of Jointly's AI, our algorithm has taken personalization to new heights. Jointly AI harnesses the power of Matches to deliver bespoke product recommendations, making the path to the perfect cannabis experience smoother and more intuitive than ever before.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the Consumer: A World of Choice, Simplified\r\n\r\n\r\nThe modern cannabis market is a vast sea of choices, from classic flower products to innovative edibles and beyond. While this diversity is exciting, it can also be overwhelming. Our algorithm cuts through the noise, guiding consumers to products that are statistically most likely to meet their needs. It's not just about the likelihood of satisfaction; it's about opening doors to new possibilities and ensuring every choice is informed and purposeful.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut the true magic of Jointly lies in its learning curve—the more you engage with the app, the smarter it gets. As users share their experiences and goals through reflections within the app, Jointly's recommendations become increasingly tailored to their unique preferences. This dynamic, personalized approach ensures that the path to the perfect cannabis experience becomes clearer and more attuned with each interaction. \r\n\r\n\r\nEmpowering Budtenders: The Art of Recommendation\r\n\r\n\r\nBudtenders are the unsung heroes of the cannabis retail experience, often relying on personal experience and product knowledge to guide consumers. Our algorithm enhances this process, providing a data-driven foundation for recommendations. It's not about replacing the personal touch; it's about augmenting it with insights that ensure every suggestion is backed by a chorus of similar experiences.\r\n\r\n\r\nElevating the Retail Experience\r\n\r\n\r\nOur algorithm acts as an invisible sales assistant, guiding consumers towards products that are most likely to delight them. By aligning your offerings with customer preferences, the selling process becomes a journey of discovery for the customer, facilitated by your store.\r\n\r\n\r\nTraining and Staff Retention\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the unique challenges in cannabis retail is the steep learning curve for new staff and the pain felt when seasoned budtenders move on. Our algorithm serves as a constant, knowledgeable presence in your store, easing the training process by providing reliable, data-backed recommendations. This not only empowers new staff but also helps in retaining valuable knowledge within your store, even in the face of turnover.\r\n\r\n\r\nConnecting People and Products\r\n\r\n\r\nThe heart of retail is connection—connecting customers with products that enhance their lives. Our algorithm excels in this, using data to forge meaningful connections between your customers and their ideal cannabis experiences. This isn't about transactions; it's about building relationships and trust, ensuring customers feel understood and valued every time they step into your store.\r\n\r\n\r\nDriving Sales with Data\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the end, it's about the bottom line, and here's where our algorithm truly shines. By providing recommendations that customers trust, we're not just improving individual sales; we're increasing the likelihood of repeat visits and word-of-mouth referrals. Happy customers become brand ambassadors, sharing their positive experiences and bringing in new business.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Conclusion\r\n\r\n\r\nJointly's product matching algorithm isn't just technology; it's a paradigm shift in how cannabis products are recommended and consumed. It's about empowering everyone in the cannabis ecosystem with data-driven insights that elevate the entire experience. Whether you're a consumer seeking your next favorite product, a budtender aiming to provide the best advice, or a retailer looking to enhance your sales process, Jointly's algorithm is your partner in creating a more informed, satisfying, and personalized cannabis journey.",

    "content": "﻿Industry Innovators: David Kooi, Co-founder and CEO of Jointly\r\n Keegan Williams \r\n\r\nBy Keegan Williams\r\nJune 7, 2023\r\nToday’s world of cannabis looks immensely different than it did in years past. While the tired stoner stereotype was likely never an accurate depiction of the cannabis community as a whole, today’s varied collection of cannabis consumers have truly dated the trope.\r\nFrom young adults simply looking for an alternative way to unwind, to parents and seniors similarly looking to manage stress or other symptoms, to folks looking for an alternative to opioids and other treatments and many more, it’s clear today’s cannabis consumers partake for a wide variety of reasons.\r\nWith the unparalleled amount of cannabis products on shelves today, and new innovations happening routinely, it can be hard to keep up. When it comes to new consumers, diving into cannabis can feel even more daunting. And even for the cannabis industry itself, it can be a struggle to hone in on what exactly it is that consumers want out of the space.\r\nThat’s where \r\nJointly comes in. The “cannabis discovery company” was built on the premise that purposeful cannabis consumption is essential in unlocking the best version of oneself. According to the company website, it’s the industry’s first and only experience-based app for purposeful cannabis consumption, allowing consumers to discover new products and reflect on their own experiences. App insights then help consumers to reach their consumption goals. Jointly is also branching out, providing tools to dispensaries and budtenders to help patrons to find the best products for their needs.\r\nJointly Co-founder and CEO David Kooi didn’t start using cannabis himself until later in his life, and he found that taking a more intentional approach helped him to discover his optimal cannabis experience. With Jointly, he’s able to share that same gift with everyone.\r\n“At Jointly, we’ve grown to call it ‘purposeful cannabis consumption’ as kind of the mantra that we have, or the ethos underneath the whole company,” Kooi said. “That’s about being intentional about the reasons you’re using cannabis and mindful about the factors that can impact your results. Just consume purposefully, and you’ll get better results.”\r\n Jointly \r\n\r\nCourtesy of Jointly\r\nA Co-founder’s Journey of Purposeful Consumption\r\nSome of that initial intention likely came from maturity, as Kooi shared his own cannabis journey didn’t begin until he was about 37. In fact, he believed the stigma, admitting that he was ignorant of cannabis and its benefits for most of his life.\r\n“I grew up in the ’80s, in Chicago,” Kooi said. “So, I grew up with (cannabis use) as, ‘You’re on drugs,” Nancy Reagan, et cetera, et cetera. And never in that early part of my life, never gave cannabis a chance. I was just kind of like, ‘Well, I don’t do drugs. I generally follow the law. I like my lungs the way they are.’ And back then, in my mind, cannabis was just about smoking, so I never really paid much mind.”\r\nThat was until he moved to California and experienced the cannabis world from a new perspective. Kooi said that living in the Golden State helped to expose him to better education on the health, wellness and medicinal benefits of cannabis.\r\nEventually in 2012, he said, “I discovered a whole new world inside a pack of peach gummies. I’m not much of a smoker because I’ve never liked the sensation. It’s just not my thing, but under California’s MediCal program, I learned there’s all kinds of other ingestion methods that don’t involve combusting.”\r\nKooi explained that he’s always been prone to anxiety and naturally wired as a more “fidgety, high-stress personality.” He was immediately amazed by the potential of cannabis edibles as he started experimenting with them that year.\r\n“You know when you’re really concentrating on something, your forehead’s all furrowed and you take a minute and take a deep breath — maybe you rub your forehead — you’re like, ‘Oh, I didn’t realize I was so wound up.’ That’s kind of the feeling that cannabis like gives to me on the inside. It’s like, ‘Oh, I didn’t realize I could see I didn’t realize I could feel this relaxed and this chill and, with the right dose, still being present and still being useful and productive.'”\r\nHe began to integrate cannabis into a multitude of areas of his life, from hiking to meditation to exercise or even sitting down with a good book. Though, as he explored further, he also noticed the lack of quality educational information available to consumers. Albeit, this was a decade ago and a lot has changed since, but especially as someone with anxiety, the right dose can make all the difference, either making you feel great or even worse, he explained.\r\n“Some of that frustration is then what eventually later led to what Jointly is,” Kooi said. “I learned that the plant can be used for many different purposes, that it affects everyone differently and that there’s at least 15 factors that can impact your experience, with everything from not just the product and the dose but setting your mindset, your hydration level, the quality of your diet that day, how well you’re sleeping, all those kinds of things. So my analytical mind kind of approached cannabis in that way for myself, and then that eventually led to what Jointly is to me.”\r\n  \r\n\r\niStock\r\nJointly is Born\r\nPrior to founding Jointly, Kooi had a storied post-college resume starting with operations management, leading to the “thread that ties together my professional career,” he said, working with statistics, his major. Kooi said he’s always using data to solve his problems and that this was a regular theme in the jobs he worked at through the 2000s.\r\nAround 2009, he decided to leave the corporate world to start a bicycle store in Woodland Hills, the Santa Monica Mountains Cyclery. Starting from scratch from an old Sprint store ignited Kooi’s entrepreneurial spirit. During that time — and after he sold the business and moved to Colorado where he currently resides — he stayed in touch with his friend Eric Gutshall, the co-founder of Jointly.\r\nKooi eventually revealed to Gutshall that he was a cannabis consumer. The pair then began to brainstorm what a new cannabis business could look like, discussing some of Kooi’s frustrations as a consumer in the ever-changing market.\r\n“We combined those ideas into what the Jointly consumer app is,” Kooi said. “… If you just look at it from the highest possible level, the goal of the app is to help people find success with cannabis, whatever that means for them.”\r\nThe Jointly app allows users to choose what goals they want to achieve through cannabis. They then track their consumption, including 15 factors that can impact their results, and then the app analytics help to dial in all of the combined factors to get the results they’re after.\r\nAt the time of publication, Jointly was up to almost 500,000 unique experiences shared by users to the platform, “which I’m super happy and proud of because, to me, that means we’ve made something useful,” Kooi said.\r\nPurposeful cannabis consumption can happen without the app, and countless consumers already practice purposeful consumption without using Jointly, Kooi said. Rather, Jointly acts as a guide through purposeful consumption.\r\nThe Jointly consumer app launched in spring of 2020. So far, the reception has been positive, and the team consistently monitors user suggestions to further optimize the app. They’ve also moved to expand the app for use in cannabis retail settings.\r\nA Purpose-Driven App for Consumers and Retailers\r\nFor new consumers especially, walking into a dispensary can be an overwhelming experience. Simply the amount of different brands, ingestion methods and potencies can be an incredibly intimidating experience, but Jointly is looking to change that.\r\nAs users continue to interact with the app, they can rate products on a one-to-10 scale for how well it helped them to achieve their goals. For businesses, the app accumulates the product performance data to predict the performance of a given cannabis product based on its characteristics, Kooi explained.\r\nBy 2021, the app had accumulated enough data to make “meaningful predictions” about product performance, Kooi said. The Jointly team presented a number of retail workers, from owners to budtenders, with different prototypes to assist customers and patients.\r\n“\r\nJointly is a tool that that resulted from all that user feedback,” Kooi said\r\n Jointly \r\n\r\nCourtesy of Jointly\r\nThe tool, which officially launched in late 2022, runs on a tablet or any screen that fits the store’s workflow. As a budtender converses with a customer or patient, they can use Jointly to narrow down what products best fit their individual needs.\r\n“It’s kind of a shared experience with the consumer and the budtender,” Kooi said. “Together, the budtenders selects the person’s goal, the person’s product type and then through our connection with that stores point of sale system, the tool shows, ‘Well, here are the products in the store that are proven to work for the reasons,’ why you want to use them based on nothing but the sum of everybody else’s experiences with with those products.”\r\nGiven that Jointly uses the same interface as the consumer app, emphasizing multiple factors and mindful consumption, Kooi said it also acts as a way to educate the consumer around cannabis consumption as a whole, while potentially exposing them to new products they might love and may not have otherwise tried.\r\nIt’s also a great tool for budtenders, given that most retail workers don’t have the ability to try every individual product for themselves. Additionally, Jointly makes it easier for new budtenders to stand by product recommendations, giving customers and patients assurance that no matter the experience level, they will enjoy a consistent experience from their budtenders.\r\nIt’s also important to note that Jointly only works with legal, compliant and licensed products, brands stores and retailers, and all its data is private, anonymous and securely collected.\r\nJointly Presses Forward as a Cannabis Industry Data Leader\r\nThe cannabis industry as a whole is already taking note of Jointly’s moves. While helping individual consumers and retail establishments with their overall cannabis experience, the valuable consumer data Jointly collects also proves to offer even broader benefits.\r\nIn April, Jointly released \r\na report showing why people consume cannabis (most are looking to relax, refresh and relieve everyday stress), what impacts their cannabis experience most (dose and product choice are the top factors) and what products work best to relieve specific symptoms.\r\nKooi said he’s eager to see what future findings hold as the dataset grows. He pointed to a paper he published last year, \r\n“The Theory of Purposeful Cannabis Consumption,” which used Jointly data to show that the stigma behind cannabis is false.\r\n Jointly \r\n\r\nCourtesy of Jointly\r\n“If you start mathematically with the idea that cannabis plus you is less than you — which is the stigma, like if you take cannabis and add it to your life, it’ll make you less — that’s basically the way of summing up the stigma which has been believed in for a long time. We used our data to prove that cannabis plus you is greater than you, because people on our platform use cannabis for reasons that improve their lives… We have basically all the data to support why that’s true and how it’s possible.\r\n“I enjoy the data aspect of things, and it’s a dataset that doesn’t really exist anywhere else. So, we’re always looking for the stories we can tell using that data to kind of help move things along.”\r\nThe team is currently building out capabilities to match users with the right products for their goals in the consumer app, along with a network of retailers so users can browse and shop from their local dispensaries using Jointly’s unique data. Kooi said the team is also focused on getting the word out to retailers about Jointly while continuing to improve the consumer app.\r\nThe cannabis company is also working on training its own AI-based version of Chat GPT for the app using the hundreds of articles for \r\nJointly Magazine, living on the Jointly website.\r\nFor cannabis businesses like Jointly, the future is full of potential, and the present simultaneously shows just how far we’ve come.\r\n“(Cannabis consumption is) a journey of experimentation and practice and reflection. Some people take to cannabis right away, and it’s wonderful for them. Other people need more guidance, so either self-guidance or help from a coach or a friend. But the industry has certainly come a long way in that way over the years, and we try to be part of it.”",

    "content": "﻿Jointly's CEO David Kooi on the Theory of Purposeful Cannabis Consumption\r\nIt's not about getting high; it's about living better\r\n Profile picture for user Jessica MacAulay \r\n\r\nBy Jessica MacAulay on Aug 18 2022 - 9:15am\r\n David Kooi | Photo illustration by Ashley Epping \r\n\r\nDavid Kooi | Photo illustration by Ashley Epping\r\nDavid Kooi loves cannabis, science, music, and using data to solve problems.\r\nPrior to co-founding cannabis wellness company Jointly, he combined his background in leadership and analytics for Fortune 500 companies with his passion for nature and endurance sports to create the Santa Monica Mountains Cyclery, which he later sold to Trek Bicycle. He also plays the banjo, but not very well.\r\nKooi graduated from Northwestern University with a BA in economics and statistics before earning his MBA from the University of Chicago Booth School of Business. We spoke with David for our Higher Calling series, where we chat with leaders in the cannabis space.\r\n________________\r\n\r\n\r\nDavid, tell us...\r\nWhere you grew up, and where you live now.\r\nI grew up in Chicago, lived in Southern California for about 20 years, and recently moved to the Denver area.\r\nYour current role in the cannabis industry, and where you're based. \r\nI am the CEO and co-founder of Jointly, the cannabis wellness company. We're a fully remote company and I am based near Denver.\r\nA story about the positive impact cannabis has had on your life. \r\nMy life is better because cannabis is in it. Cannabis has opened new worlds for me, inside and out. It enhances my favorite experiences. Music, hiking and writing. It calms my busy mind and enables me to focus and think more clearly. With the right dose, it stimulates my creativity and helps me draw together previously unrelated topics to find new truths. It helps me manage my anxiety. I sleep better. I enjoy a deeper connection to moments, people and places. The positive impact cannabis has had on me is why I started Jointly. Most cannabis consumers know that cannabis makes their life better. Now we're proving it, with data. We just published \"The Theory of Purposeful Cannabis Consumption\" in which we use a combination of Jointly's data and outside data to prove that cannabis, consumed purposefully, makes you more—not less. Ending the stigma. Mathematically, at least.\r\nA favorite flower, edible, product or brand.\r\nI am currently exploring edible products with a 1:1 THC:CBG ratio for energizing, focusing, and stimulating creativity, while I prefer products with THC and CBD (usually with the CBD in a higher proportion) for relaxation and stress relief, and to help keep me off the dad Skittles (Advil) to recover from exercise—and to recover from working at a computer for most of the day. Jointly is an unbiased platform where people can find the best brands and products for them, so I don't like to express my personal brand or product preferences. The right products for me might be the wrong products for you, depending on your goals and your unique endocannabinoid system.\r\nThe biggest challenge cannabis marketers face today.\r\nCannabis is misunderstood. Most consumers don't know that: cannabis is a complex plant that produces a variety of effects. People use cannabis for many different productive purposes. Cannabis affects each person differently. People realize their goals more often when they create the conditions for a good experience. Until the consumer learns and internalizes these truths, and discards the stigma that has taught too many people that cannabis makes them less, not more—cannabis marketers will be navigating into strong headwinds. And, of course, the social media restrictions are annoying and unfair and (again) rooted in the stigma. How do you reach people when you can't meet them where they are? Most people are on social media.\r\nOne thing you're excited about right now in cannabis branding, partnerships or marketing.\r\nI see more and more brands selling their products by emphasizing the effects they will have on the consumer. Products specifically formulated and marketed to energize, uplift, improve sleep, improve focus. We call it purposeful consumption. Consumers already consume purposefully. It's not about getting high. It's about living better. I'm excited to see brands emerging from the past that was rooted in strains, strain types, cannabinoids, and terpenes—and focus on the kind of experience their products provide. Market and sell based on the reasons why people consume—not the ingredients. If we can make cannabis easier, more people will get to enjoy its benefits.\r\nA cannabis trade/social justice organization that you support.\r\nI admire NORML's history, consistency, and dedication to reforming the laws that govern cannabis production and consumption. They've been on the right side of history since their founding in 1970, while a large part of the rest of the country was busy stigmatizing cannabis and putting producers and consumers in jail and firing them from jobs. I'm happy that we now have the data to prove that NORML was right all along.\r\nA recent project you're proud of.\r\nJointly recently became the first company to include reimbursement for legal cannabis consumption as part of our company wellness benefit. I'm proud of this because it's one of my missions to create a new conversation about cannabis wellness, and with this action we're elevating cannabis to its proper place among exercise, meditation, massage, a good diet, and proper hydration—as a tool for finding new pathways to wellbeing.\r\nSomeone else's project you admired recently.\r\nI really admire what Max Simon and the folks at Green Flower have done with their Ganjier program. The job of the budtender is so vital and the difficulty of performing that job well is undervalued and underappreciated. We ask budtenders to be therapists, pharmacists, psychologists, educators, merchandisers, plant biologists, sales people, promoters of brands, and friends to the consumer. I support all efforts to elevate their role in the industry and help make their jobs easier.\r\nSomeone you admire in cannabis who's doing great things.\r\nA tough one. There are so many great people doing great things in cannabis. I'll generalize and say that I admire the cannabis retailer. Retail is tough. It's hard to get a license. It's hard to market your business and get the word out. It's hard to hire good employees. It's hard to educate a skeptical and cautious public. It's hard to sort through the thousands of brands and products to find the ones you should stock in your store. Once in your store, it's hard to connect people to products. Taxes are too high. Competition from unlicensed stores and sellers is strong, and unfair. They are forced to fight on an unfair playing field, yet I go into so many cannabis retailers these days and find people dedicated to their mission. Fighting the good fight. Helping people, one customer at a time, discover the better life that is possible with cannabis.\r\nWhat you'd be doing if you weren't in the cannabis industry.\r\nI work in cannabis because I love cannabis. I believe that cannabis legalization and normalization is a tremendous opportunity to improve our collective wellbeing. Previously, I worked in bicycle retail because I loved bicycles. Who is not happy when they get a new bike? When is it not a good time for a bike ride? So, if not cannabis, I'd probably be doing something else I love and trying to find a way to have a positive impact on that subject, too. What else do I love … Music? Plants? Mushrooms? Hiking? Trees? Save for later. It's cannabis, for now.",

    "content": "﻿The 15 factors that impact your cannabis experience\r\n\r\n\r\nCannabis is a powerful tool for improving your physical and emotional well-being. People use cannabis to live better: to relax, relieve stress, sleep better, manage pain, improve focus, and enhance creativity. It can be an integral part of a healthy lifestyle.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe myth of the lazy stoner is dying a well-deserved death. America is waking up to the fact that cannabis consumers are also productive and valuable members of their communities. They are good people, parents, friends, neighbors, employers, and employees.\r\n\r\n\r\nYet many consumers struggle to get the results they deserve from cannabis. \r\n\r\n\r\nInconsistent and unreliable outcomes\r\n\r\n\r\nWe’ve all heard the story from the friend who ate the pot brownie that knocked them off their feet, caused anxiety and paranoia, and they haven’t touched cannabis since.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut it’s not just new consumers that struggle. Experienced cannabis enthusiasts understand the difference between that perfect feeling – the mood state they’re after every time – and the frustrating, inconsistent, and unreliable effects they sometimes endure in pursuit of that ideal experience.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is that ideal experience that consumers seek? According to New Frontier Data’s 2021 Cannabis Consumer Evolution report, consumers site these reasons for their cannabis use:\r\n* Relaxation – 67%\r\n* Stress Relief – 62%\r\n* Reducing Anxiety – 54%\r\n* Improving Sleep Quality – 46%\r\n* Pain Management – 45%\r\n* Falling Asleep – 44%\r\n* Enjoying Social Experiences – 34%\r\n* Increasing Overall Wellness – 34%\r\n* Treating a Medical Condition – 22%\r\n* Stimulating Creativity – 21%\r\n\r\nThese are worthy objectives that support happier, healthier, and more productive lives.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut the results people get are inconsistent. Sometimes products have the opposite of the intended effect. While some consumers use cannabis to treat occasional anxiety and paranoia, others report anxiety and paranoia as side effects of their cannabis consumption. While some consumers use cannabis to improve sleep, others report drowsiness as an unintended side effect. While some consumers use cannabis to stimulate appetite, others find themselves overeating with the munchies. While some consumers use cannabis to improve focus or creativity, others report disorientation and memory issues as side effects.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe modern cannabis consumer deserves better. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExpect more from cannabis\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is good news: You can expect more from your cannabis experience. Achieving your ideal experience every time is attainable and under your control.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are 15 factors that can impact your cannabis experience. These 15 factors fall into 4 categories:\r\n\r\n\r\nYour purpose. The first step is to identify the reason you consume (or are interested in consuming) cannabis. Are you looking to relax? Focus on work? Engage in a creative activity? Enjoy a social experience? Sleep better? Recover from exercise?\r\n \r\nYour products. The products you choose can profoundly impact your experience. The right product to help you sleep is likely the wrong one to help you enjoy a social situation. The right product to ease your pain is likely the wrong one to stimulate your creativity. Cannabis is a complex plant and the formulation of the products you are using matters more than most people realize. Some products are better than others at delivering on their promises.\r\n\r\n\r\nYour methods. Dosing is critical. Finding the minimum effective dose (for your purpose) is an essential step in getting the results you deserve and avoiding adverse effects. The time you wait between doses, the ingestion method, and whether your stomach is full or empty also impact your experience. There are also certain companion foods that may enhance or otherwise impact your experience.\r\n\r\n\r\nYour lifestyle factors. Because of the way cannabis works with your endocannabinoid system to effect hormones, your experience is impacted by the sleep you get, how hydrated you are, the quality of your diet, your exercise and fitness routines, the setting in which you enjoy your cannabis, and the company you keep.\r\n\r\n\r\nGet better results (Alt 1)\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter deciding on your purpose, there are several ways to modify your product choices, methods, and other factors to achieve your ideal experience more often. You can:\r\n* Practice and learn via trial and error\r\n* Get advice from friends and budtenders\r\n* See a medical professional\r\n* Use a written strain journal or consumption journal\r\n* Use free mobile applications provided by Releaf, Strainprint, or Jointly\r\n\r\n\r\nWith data, you can make cannabis perform better for you. When asked to rate their cannabis experience prior to using the Jointly app on a scale of 1 to 10, consumers rate their success at 6.3 out of 10. After tracking their consumption to take control of those 15 factors, those same consumers rate their success at 8.5 out of 10.\r\n\r\n\r\nGet better results (Alt 2)\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter deciding on your purpose, there are several ways to modify your product choices, methods, and other factors to achieve your ideal experience more often.

When you make good, healthy choices throughout your day – you eat well, you get your 8 hours of sleep, you exercise, you drink your water, you stay away from toxic people and situations, you live or work in a comfortable setting – you enjoy your cannabis experience even more. It’s a virtuous circle.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout the author\r\nDavid Kooi is Co-Founder and CEO of Jointly.

    "content": "﻿Dear Cannabis Retailers,\r\nMy name is David Kooi, and I am the Co-Founder and CEO of Jointly. As someone deeply passionate about the transformative potential of cannabis, I am excited to share with you the story of Jointly and how our platform can revolutionize your business.\r\nWhy am I writing this letter?\r\n\r\nWhen I owned and managed a retail bicycle shop, I didn’t let people who wanted to sell me things get anywhere near me. \r\nEven when I went to bicycle and outdoor industry conferences, I couldn’t wear a name tag with my shop name on it - because, if I did, people wouldn’t leave me be. \r\n\r\nIt’s not that I don’t like people. It’s that I don’t like being sold things.\r\nI suspect many of you are the same. \r\nThe purpose of this letter is to transparently illustrate how partnering with Jointly can benefit your dispensary. My goal is to demonstrate how our innovative approach can help you increase sales, enhance customer satisfaction, and boost customer retention. \r\nIf what I’m saying resonates with what you’re trying to accomplish, I’d love the opportunity to talk with you or someone from your team. \r\nThesis statement\r\nAt Jointly, we believe that purposeful cannabis consumption is the key to unlocking a better you. Our platform is designed to empower consumers and your business with data-driven insights and personalized recommendations, ensuring that your customers find the right products for their needs and have the best possible experience with the products you sell. By integrating Jointly's tools into your operations, you can build a stronger, more loyal customer base and drive your sales to new heights.\r\nProblems in the cannabis industry that I want to help with\r\nDespite the increasing acceptance and legalization of cannabis, the industry is still plagued by challenges and misconceptions. Many consumers are confused about how to use cannabis effectively. The market often emphasizes price and potency over experience and quality, leading to inconsistent and sometimes negative outcomes for users. This lack of reliable, data-driven guidance makes it difficult for consumers to find the right products for their needs, and for retailers to make informed recommendations.\r\nJointly’s mission and vision\r\nAt Jointly, our mission is to educate consumers and provide them with the tools they need to practice intentional and goal-oriented cannabis use. Through our platform, we help users understand the diverse benefits of cannabis, experiment with different products and methods, and reflect on their experiences. By doing so, we aim to elevate the entire cannabis experience, ensuring that consumers achieve their desired outcomes more consistently and enjoyably. Jointly is here to transform how people approach cannabis, fostering a community that values purpose, performance, and personalization over mere price and potency.\r\nConsumer-focused features\r\nThe Jointly app is designed with the consumer in mind, aiming to promote purposeful cannabis consumption. Our app empowers users to approach cannabis with intention, helping them achieve their desired outcomes. By focusing on why people use cannabis and how it affects them, the Jointly app guides users towards more meaningful and effective experiences.\r\nKey features of the Jointly app include:\r\n* Tracking Goals: Users can set and track their personal goals for cannabis consumption, whether it's to relax, relieve stress, improve sleep, or any of the other 12 distinct goals we've identified.\r\n* Rating Products: After consuming a product, users can rate its effectiveness in achieving their goals. This feedback is crucial in building a comprehensive database of product performance.\r\n* Understanding Factors Impacting Experiences: The app helps users reflect on various factors that can influence their cannabis experience, such as dosage, method of consumption, hydration levels, and even their environment. This holistic approach ensures that users can fine-tune their consumption for optimal results.\r\n* Personalized Shopping Recommendations: Users can shop from partnered dispensaries and receive tailored product recommendations. These suggestions are based on their personal goals, reflections, and the collective experiences of other Jointly users, making the shopping experience more informed and personalized​​​​​.\r\nImpact on consumers\r\nThe impact of the Jointly app on consumers has been profound. Our data shows that users who practice purposeful consumption report significantly better experiences. In fact, consumers who use the app to track their goals and reflect on their consumption report a nearly 50% improvement in the quality of their cannabis experiences. Since 2020, about a half a million people have downloaded and used our app. Here are a few testimonials from our community:\r\n* \"Since I started using Jointly, I've been able to find the perfect products for my needs. My sleep has improved drastically, and I feel more energized during the day.\" - Jane L.\r\n* \"The app helped me understand the importance of dosage and setting. Now, I enjoy social situations much more with the right cannabis products.\" - Mark R.\r\n* \"Jointly's tracking and reflection features have turned my cannabis use into a mindful practice. I feel more in control and get better results.\" - Sarah L.\r\nCommunity and data-driven insights\r\nOne of the most powerful aspects of Jointly is our data-driven approach. By collecting and analyzing goal-specific product performance data from hundreds of thousands of users, we provide unparalleled insights into what works best for different consumption goals. This community-generated data allows us to offer unbiased, reliable recommendations that benefit both consumers and retailers.\r\nOur platform aggregates real user experiences to highlight which products deliver the best results for specific goals. No brand or manufacturer can pay for better ratings or placement, ensuring that our recommendations are based solely on authentic consumer feedback. This level of transparency and accuracy not only helps consumers make informed decisions but also supports retailers in selling the best-performing products for their customers' needs.\r\nJointly is not just an app; it's a community dedicated to enhancing the cannabis experience through purposeful consumption and data-driven insights. Together, we are transforming how people engage with cannabis, making it more effective, enjoyable, and beneficial for everyone involved.\r\nJointly for retailers\r\nNow getting to the part about you. I am excited to tell you about our solutions for retailers, our cutting-edge budtender sales assistant designed to seamlessly integrate with your existing point-of-sale (POS) systems. Our tools leverage Jointly's extensive database of goal-specific product performance data to empower budtenders with personalized, data-driven insights. This innovative tool helps budtenders make informed recommendations and answer every question accurately, ensuring customers find the right products for their specific needs and goals. \r\nFor budtenders, this means feeling valued, productive, efficient, and truly capable of making a difference.\r\nBenefits of Jointly for Retailers\r\n* Improved Budtender Training and Performance: Jointly for retailers is more than just a tool; it's an invaluable training resource. New and experienced budtenders alike can use Jointly to quickly learn about product efficacy, customer preferences, and best practices in cannabis sales. By providing real-time access to goal-specific data, Jointly enhances budtender knowledge and performance, enabling them to deliver exceptional service consistently.\r\n* Enhanced Customer Recommendations: Using data from hundreds of thousands of consumer experiences, Jointly provides budtenders with precise recommendations tailored to each customer's goals. Whether a customer is seeking relaxation, pain relief, or increased focus, Jointly guides budtenders to suggest the most effective products. This personalized approach not only improves customer satisfaction but also builds trust and loyalty.\r\n* Receive Orders for Pickup or Delivery: When your dispensary is connected to the Jointly platform, you can also receive orders for pickup or delivery (where available) from our growing community of app users. This feature not only expands your customer base but also provides a convenient shopping experience for consumers who prefer to order online. By offering seamless integration with your POS system, Jointly ensures that you can manage these orders efficiently and effectively, further driving sales and customer satisfaction.\r\n* Self-Service Kiosk Option: For busier stores or those operating on a tight budget, Jointly can also be used as a self-service kiosk. While our preference is for the guided budtender/consumer collaborative experience, the self-service option allows customers to interact directly with Jointly, receive personalized recommendations, and make informed purchases independently. This flexibility ensures that all customers receive the support they need, even during peak hours or in stores with limited staffing.\r\n* Jointly's Virtual Budtender on Your Website: Jointly also offers an option to integrate directly into your dispensary’s website. This feature allows customers to access goal-specific product recommendations from the comfort of their homes, making it easier for them to select products that align with their needs. Whether they're new to cannabis or seasoned enthusiasts, customers will benefit from the same level of personalized guidance online as they would in-store. This option enhances the shopping experience, drives online sales, and extends the reach of your dispensary’s expertise beyond the physical storefront.\r\nImpact on sales and customer experience\r\n* Increasing Average Ticket Size: Jointly's ability to make data-driven recommendations has a direct impact on sales. By guiding customers to products that are more likely to meet their needs, Jointly encourages higher spending per visit. Retailers using Jointly have reported an increase in average ticket size, as customers are more inclined to purchase additional products that align with their consumption goals.\r\n* Boosting Customer Satisfaction: When customers receive tailored recommendations that lead to better cannabis experiences, their satisfaction levels rise. Happy customers are more likely to return and recommend your dispensary to others. Jointly ensures that each customer leaves with products that are right for them, enhancing their overall experience and increasing the likelihood of repeat business.\r\n* Mitigating the Impact of Budtender Turnover: High turnover rates in the cannabis industry can be challenging for retailers. Training new staff is time-consuming and costly. Jointly mitigates this issue by serving as an AI assistant that new budtenders can rely on from day one. It provides consistent, data-backed recommendations, reducing the learning curve and ensuring that customer service quality remains high regardless of staff changes.\r\n* Trusted Source of Truth: Jointly is also trained with cannabis consumption best practices, leveraging the extensive data Jointly has gathered on effective cannabis use. It serves as a reliable and trustworthy source of information for both budtenders and consumers, acting as a \"Wikipedia for cannabis.\" This ensures that everyone involved in the purchasing process is well-informed, promoting better decision-making and more positive outcomes.\r\nJointly represents a significant advancement in cannabis retail technology. By integrating this AI assistant into your operations, you can enhance your budtender training, improve customer satisfaction, and drive sales growth. At Jointly, we are committed to helping retailers succeed by providing the tools and insights needed to excel in the evolving cannabis market.\r\nEthical selling and education\r\nAt Jointly, we believe that ethical selling and consumer education are paramount in the cannabis industry. As retailers, you have a unique responsibility to guide customers towards safe and effective cannabis use. Educating consumers about the various factors that influence their cannabis experience not only fosters trust but also empowers them to make informed decisions. Jointly’s platform provides the tools and data needed to deliver this education, helping your customers achieve their desired outcomes and promoting responsible consumption.\r\nUpselling and customer retention\r\nUpselling often carries a negative connotation, but in the cannabis industry it can be a powerful tool for enhancing customer satisfaction and driving revenue. The key is to ensure that upselling is done ethically and with the customer's best interests in mind. Jointly assists budtenders in making personalized recommendations that align with each customer’s goals, transforming upselling into a positive experience. By helping customers find the right products for their needs, you not only increase the average ticket size but also build long-term loyalty. Satisfied customers who see real benefits from their purchases are more likely to return and recommend your store to others.\r\nEasy integration and full support\r\nAt Jointly, we prioritize making the integration process as smooth as possible for retailers. Here's how we ensure ease of use and comprehensive support:\r\n* Simple Onboarding Process: Retailers sign a contract and provide their API key. We handle the rest.\r\n* Catalog Setup and Maintenance: Jointly takes care of all the catalog setup and maintenance, ensuring that product listings are accurate and up-to-date with no additional work required from the retailer.\r\n* Comprehensive Budtender Training: We offer various levels of budtender training tailored to your needs, from on-site training to remote sessions. We are committed to providing continuous support to ensure your budtenders are well-equipped to maximize their success.\r\n* Ongoing Support: Our team is always available to assist and support retailers, ensuring smooth operations and helping to overcome any challenges.\r\nIntegration with existing systems\r\nWe understand that seamless integration with your current operations is crucial. That’s why Jointly is designed to complement, not compete with, your existing systems. Our platform integrates effortlessly with your POS system, providing additional layers of data and insights without disrupting your workflow. Jointly enhances your current setup by offering goal-specific product recommendations and performance insights that can be accessed directly through your existing infrastructure. This ensures that you can leverage the full power of Jointly’s data-driven approach while maintaining the efficiency and familiarity of your established processes.\r\nInvitation to partner\r\nAt Jointly, we are dedicated to helping retailers like you thrive in the evolving cannabis market.

    "content": "﻿Updated Jointly and Virtual Budtender Retailer / Dispensary Sales Pitch\r\n\r\n1. Introduction: Building Connection\r\nHi [Name], I’m David Kooi, CEO of Jointly. Thanks for taking the time to connect today. Before we dive in, I want to share a little bit about myself and why I’m so passionate about what we’re building at Jointly.\r\nMy background might surprise you - I spent 10 years as a bicycle retailer before moving into cannabis tech. Running a retail business taught me what it really takes to create great customer experiences, build trust with customers, and ensure that promises turn into results. I know that the cannabis industry has been flooded with tech companies over-promising and under-delivering, and I don’t take your time or trust for granted.\r\nIn fact, I recently wrote an article for Cannabis Uncaged sharing everything I learned from my years in retail and how those lessons can apply to cannabis retail. It’s my way of laying an olive branch at your feet because I understand that as a retailer, you’ve likely heard a lot of pitches before, and I want to prove to you that I’m here to be a real partner. If you’re interested, you can check out that article here: [insert link].\r\nSo with that in mind, let’s talk about how we can help solve some of the challenges you might be facing. What is it about Jointly that interests you the most? And how does that tie into any specific challenges or opportunities you’re looking to address in your business today?\r\n[Pause and actively listen to their response. This will help you tailor your next steps.]\r\n________________\r\n\r\n\r\n2. The Problem: Setting the Stage\r\nGot it. Let’s jump right in. You’ve got great Budtenders in your store, right? They’re there during store hours to guide customers - helping them find exactly what they’re looking for and answering any questions they’ve got. But here’s the thing: when customers visit your website, it’s like they’re walking into an unmanned store and just staring at a catalog. No guidance, no personal touch.\r\nAnd let’s be honest, most people need guidance. That’s why you have Budtenders in-store, not just a row of vending machines. So what if your website could offer the same personal, data-driven experience as your in-store Budtenders?\r\n________________\r\n\r\n\r\n3. The Solution: Introducing the Virtual Budtender\r\nThat’s why we created the Virtual Budtender. It’s powered by real data from our consumer app and can be customized entirely to reflect your brand. Think of it as your 24/7 online Budtender - always available to help your customers decide what to buy and answer questions about your store.\r\nIt’s incredibly easy to set up and customize: your voice, your store policies, hours, parking info, founder story - basically anything you want. And the best part? It lives on your website, always ready to serve your customers whenever they need it.\r\n________________\r\n\r\n\r\n4. Demonstration: Showing the Magic\r\nLet me give you a quick demo of the kinds of questions the Virtual Budtender can answer for your customers.\r\n[Here, Dave will insert the list of categories and questions for the demo.]\r\n[Run through the demo and ensure the prospect sees the value in the depth and personalization of the Virtual Budtender’s responses.]\r\n________________\r\n\r\n\r\n5. How It Works: The Technology and Data Behind It\r\nSo, how does it all work? At the core is the latest Frontier AI technology - right now, we believe GPT-4o delivers the best results, but we’re committed to always keeping the platform up to date with the latest advancements. But here’s where it gets really interesting: it’s not just the AI that’s powering this. It’s the data. And that’s where our consumer app comes in.\r\n________________\r\n\r\n\r\n6. The Data: Powered Jointly by Purposeful Consumption\r\nSince 2020, we’ve been helping consumers practice purposeful consumption with our app. People use it to set goals, track their product choices, and log how those choices impact their experience. We’ve collected hundreds of thousands of reflections, and every single one of them makes our data smarter and more actionable.\r\nHere’s what’s in that data:\r\n* Goal-Specific Product Performance, Flavor, and Aroma: When people reflect, they tell us things like why they’re using cannabis, the product they used, and how well it worked for their specific goal (on a scale of 1-10). They also rate aroma and often leave notes about their experience. We take all that feedback and sum it into a product recommendation algorithm that powers the Virtual Budtender. And here’s the key difference: our AI isn’t just spitting out a guess. It’s using a living, breathing algorithm built on real-world data to make smarter recommendations.\r\n* Consumption Best Practices and Insights: Consumers also report on what’s working, what’s not, and the factors impacting their experience. That collective wisdom feeds into the AI, making it more than just a product recommender - it’s also an educator, helping your customers make better choices.\r\nAnd one more thing: our AI is also trained on the 300+ medically-reviewed articles we’ve written about cannabis consumption since 2020. So not only is it powered by data, but it’s also backed by science to give your customers the best guidance available.\r\n________________\r\n\r\n\r\n7. Additional Features: What Else You Get\r\nAnd there’s more. Your subscription also includes two additional tools that bring even more value:\r\n1. AI for Your Budtenders\r\nYour Budtenders get access to their own version of the AI. This isn’t just for customer support - it’s a professional development tool powered by the same data. Budtenders can use it to learn and upsell more effectively. For example, they can input a customer’s goal and product type, and the AI will generate a list of products in your store most likely to help that customer, based entirely on the organic data from our consumer app. It’s like having the collective wisdom of hundreds of thousands of cannabis experiences at their fingertips.\r\nIt’s easy to access, works on just about any screen, and can even be used on their phones. And it’s included for free with your subscription.\r\n   2. Your Store in the Consumer App\r\nYour dispensary will also be listed in the Jointly consumer app. This means that any of our app users in your area can browse your inventory and get product recommendations using the same system.\r\nNow, to set the right expectation, we’re not Weedmaps. We’re not bringing millions of eyeballs to your listing. But think about the kind of person who downloads an app to intentionally track their cannabis consumption. Those are probably the kinds of customers you want - the kind who care about their experience, their goals, and the products they’re using.\r\n________________\r\n\r\n\r\n8. Setup: Easy and Supported\r\nAnd let’s talk about setup - because we’ve made it super easy. It’s as simple as pasting a block of code onto your website. Sometimes there’s a little extra work to get it placed just right depending on your designs and any other elements on your site, but don’t worry - we’re here to help every step of the way. In some cases, we can even handle the setup for you.\r\n________________\r\n\r\n\r\n9. ROI and Competitive Context: Why It’s a Smart Bet\r\nLet’s talk about ROI. This technology is so new that we don’t yet have an exact ROI number, but as you can imagine, it’s going to be significant - and you’ll get to be one of the first to find out. We’re just live with a few dozen retailers, and we’d be happy to share a link so you can try it yourself.\r\nNow, you may have heard of other tools calling themselves ‘AI Budtenders’ - Derpli, Buggy, and Strainedbrain, to name a few. But if you’ve tried them or seen their demos, you know they’re just basic quizzes that spit out product results. It’s not even clear where their answers are coming from. They’ll claim to use COAs, which we use too, but what they don’t have is a living, breathing data set like ours.\r\nThey’ve been around longer, but they’re built on a previous generation of technology. And even they claim carts that use their tools see twenty to twenty-five percent higher sales compared to those that don’t. So, we can expect ours to perform at least that well - likely more - especially as this tech keeps advancing. And the best part? It’s only going to get better from here.\r\n\r\nSome of our own early data backs that up. Among our initial partners, we’re seeing a 32% increase in cart sizes for customers using the Virtual Budtender compared to those who don’t. And as this technology evolves and learns, it’s only going to get better.\r\n________________\r\n\r\n\r\n10. Pricing: Delivering Value\r\nAll of this is available for $499 per month, plus $99 for each additional location. I know that might sound like a lot, but let me break it down for you:\r\n      * Think about the cost of a human employee. This Virtual Budtender is a fraction of that cost.\r\n      * It works 24/7, never takes a break, and never calls in sick.\r\n      * It helps convert more customers on your website and increases average order value while saving you time on emails and calls.\r\nWhen you compare the cost to the value - and the time and energy you’ll save - I think you’ll see it’s a bargain.\r\n________________\r\n\r\n\r\n11. Call to Action: Closing the Deal\r\nSo, what do you think? Is this something you can see helping your business? If you’re ready, I’d love to get you set up today so we can start driving results for you.",

    "content": "﻿Solving the Cannabis Puzzle\r\nHow Purposeful Consumption Can Help You Unlock the Perfect Experience\r\nBy David Kooi\r\nCannabis has the power to provide profound benefits. Yet, for many consumers, the experience remains a puzzle. Despite its growing acceptance, cannabis use can often feel like a guessing game, with unpredictable outcomes and inconsistent results. This inconsistency can lead to frustration, causing some to question the value of cannabis in their lives.\r\nSolving the cannabis puzzle requires a purposeful approach. It’s about understanding why you're consuming and aligning your product choices, doses, and habits with your personal goals. Unfortunately, the lingering stigma surrounding cannabis has clouded this understanding for years. Many still view cannabis use as a passive, aimless activity. This is a relic of outdated stereotypes. But purposeful cannabis consumption allows users to optimize their experiences and fully harness the plant’s potential.\r\nI discovered this firsthand. My journey with cannabis didn’t begin until later in life. At first, it was a mix of trial and error. While cannabis intrigued me, I often found the results unpredictable and frustrating. It wasn’t until I embraced a more intentional approach by focusing on what I wanted to achieve with each use and fine-tuning variables like dosage and product choice that cannabis became a transformative tool for improving my life. \r\n\r\nI learned how to make cannabis work for me, and this purposeful approach is now central to how I view and advocate for its use. That said, if you’ve found a different approach that works for you and enhances your life - I’m not suggesting this is the only way. There are many paths to a better experience.\r\nUnderstanding Purposeful Cannabis Consumption\r\nPurposeful cannabis consumption goes beyond using cannabis with intention - it’s a structured approach to achieving specific outcomes. Unlike habitual use, which is often routine and automatic, or intentional use, which involves some degree of mindfulness, purposeful consumption is goal-driven. It’s about experimenting, reflecting, and optimizing your cannabis use to meet your objectives. Purposeful consumption encourages you to track what works and adjust until you achieve the best possible experience.\r\nAt the core of purposeful consumption are goals. Over time, through data collected from hundreds of thousands of cannabis experiences, we at Jointly have identified 12 distinct goals that people seek when they consume cannabis: to relax and refresh, relieve stress, improve sleep, energize and uplift, ease pain, enjoy social experiences, focus, create, stimulate appetite, enhance intimacy, and even recover from exercise. On average, people have 2.4 goals. Identifying your goals is the first step in turning cannabis into a tool that can positively impact your life. With clear goals in mind, consumers can make better product choices and fine-tune their methods of consumption for more reliable results.\r\nBut purposeful consumption goes deeper than simply setting a goal and selecting a product. It’s about crafting the conditions that lead to what I call being “pie high” - a perfect 10/10 cannabis experience. The concept comes from a pie chart we developed using data from almost 400,000 unique cannabis experiences. The chart shows that your cannabis experience is made up of many factors: the product itself, the dose, the setting, and even lifestyle factors like hydration, sleep, and exercise. Just as every slice of a pie adds up to the whole, these elements must be carefully balanced to achieve that elusive “pie high” where everything comes together for the perfect experience.\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nFactors impacting the cannabis experience. Source: Jointly\r\nSolving the Puzzle Through Data\r\nAt the heart of solving the cannabis puzzle is data. With so many variables influencing each experience - from product choice and dosage to setting and timing - it’s nearly impossible to predict outcomes without a systematic approach. This is why data-driven solutions are becoming essential for cannabis consumers. Tracking consumption, reflecting on outcomes, and analyzing patterns allows individuals to optimize their experiences and move beyond trial and error.\r\nThere are several platforms and tools that help consumers log their experiences, including product types, doses, and specific goals. Over time, users can gather valuable insights into what works best for them. By reviewing their data, consumers can identify which combinations of factors consistently lead to successful outcomes. For example, if better sleep is the goal, such tools might reveal that a specific product and dose at a particular time of day are most effective.\r\nOne key piece of solving the cannabis puzzle is product selection. Data-driven algorithms can analyze a user’s consumption goals and product characteristics - such as strain, cannabinoid content, and terpene profile - to recommend products that are most likely to meet their needs. The best solutions are unbiased, relying solely on real-world performance data rather than paid placements, which makes these recommendations trustworthy and goal-specific.\r\nHowever, finding the right product is just one part of the equation. Optimizing the cannabis experience also requires considering other variables, such as dosage, timing, and environmental factors like setting and hydration. By experimenting and fine-tuning these elements, consumers can maximize their results and avoid the inconsistent experiences that often frustrate cannabis use. \r\n\r\nFull disclosure: I am a co-founder of Jointly, a platform that empowers users to take a data-driven, methodical approach to achieving their ideal cannabis experience. Our app is free for consumers, and our data shows that practicing purposeful consumption can increase a person’s self-assessed enjoyment of their cannabis experience by nearly 50% on average.\r\nCannabis Retail: Beyond Price and Potency\r\nIn cannabis retail settings, the conversation tends to circle around two familiar points: price and potency. Consumers often chase the lowest price and the highest THC percentage, believing that more THC means a better experience. But this approach overlooks the complexity of cannabis and what truly drives a satisfying, effective experience. While price and potency are easy to measure, they don’t tell the full story. In fact, focusing solely on these factors can often lead consumers to products that don’t align with their personal goals, leaving them frustrated with inconsistent results.\r\nThe reality is that cannabis consumption is highly personal, and what works for one person may not work for another. Effective cannabis use is about finding the right product that matches not just your budget, but your specific needs and goals. Whether you’re looking to relax, improve sleep, or spark creativity, there’s no one-size-fits-all solution. Personalization, driven by data and guided by your consumption goals, helps you move beyond generic recommendations and find the products that truly work for you.\r\nThe Future of Cannabis Consumption\r\nFor too long, casual or habitual use has dominated the narrative, with many consumers unsure of how to get the best out of their cannabis experiences and most consumers choosing not to participate. But as more people learn that cannabis is not just about “getting high” but about improving their well-being, it’s clear that the future of cannabis consumption lies in a more informed and purposeful approach.\r\nThis shift requires a cultural change. Cannabis can’t be about indiscriminate use or chasing the highest THC percentage. It must evolve to include an understanding of why we consume and aligning our choices with those goals. Instead of viewing cannabis purely as a recreational or medical drug, we must treat it as a wellness tool, part of a broader strategy to improve quality of life. \r\nTo fully realize this future, retailers and budtenders must play a key role in empowering consumers. It’s no longer enough to simply sell products; budtenders must be educators, guiding customers to the right products based on their unique goals and needs. By fostering conversations about purposeful consumption, budtenders can help consumers make better decisions and enjoy more consistent, satisfying experiences.\r\nI am committed to driving this shift through data, education, and technology. But ultimately, it’s a collective effort. If the industry embraces purposeful consumption, we’ll not only improve individual cannabis experiences but also elevate the conversation around cannabis, leading to a more responsible and consumer-centric marketplace.\r\nConclusion: Puzzle Solved\r\nThe cannabis puzzle is complex, but the solution lies in data, experimentation, and purpose. By understanding why we consume, using data to guide our choices, and fine-tuning the variables that impact our experiences, we can transform cannabis from a guessing game into a reliable tool for well-being. \r\nConsumers now have the tools to take control of their cannabis journeys. By embracing purposeful consumption, you can achieve better, more consistent results and enjoy a more fulfilling relationship with cannabis. So, ask yourself: What are your goals? What products and practices work best for you? With the right mindset and tools, you have the power to solve the cannabis puzzle - and make it work for you.",

    "content": "﻿The Case for Our Virtual Budtender\r\nImagining the Near Future\r\nThink about what ChatGPT can already do. \r\n\r\nNow, imagine whatever comes next.\r\nArtificial intelligence is reshaping industries and redefining the way businesses engage with their customers. This technology is about creating experiences that feel intuitive, personal, and impactful. In every industry, leaders are asking how they can harness the power of AI to transform customer interactions.\r\nWhat if your cannabis dispensary could harness a similar power - but upgraded and purpose-built for cannabis retail? \r\nImagine an AI assistant on your website, one that not only understands cannabis but also knows your dispensary: your inventory, your voice, your policies. A tool designed not just to answer questions but to actively help your customers find the perfect product for their needs, boosting sales and satisfaction in the process.\r\nThis is no longer a futuristic idea. \r\nWith Jointly’s Virtual Budtender, it’s the reality of today.\r\nWhat the Virtual Budtender Can Do\r\nThe Virtual Budtender is like having your best budtender online 24/7 - ready to assist, educate, and guide your customers through their cannabis shopping journey. It’s not just software; it’s a powerful tool tailored to your dispensary’s unique needs.\r\nHere’s how it works:\r\n* Knows Jointly’s extensive data on cannabis product performance and consumption best practices: Backed by millions of real consumer experiences and medically reviewed content, the Virtual Budtender provides recommendations that are scientifically informed and goal-specific.\r\n* Customizable to reflect your dispensary’s inventory, voice, and policies: It doesn’t just match products to consumer needs - it does so while speaking in your brand’s language, aligning with your unique store identity.\r\n* Provides personalized, data-backed recommendations: Whether it’s helping customers find a relaxing edible or a sleep-inducing tincture, the Virtual Budtender delivers suggestions designed to meet their goals.\r\n* Integrates seamlessly into your website: It’s an always-on assistant that helps customers make confident purchasing decisions, reducing frustration and boosting trust.\r\nThe Results Speak for Themselves:\r\n* Boosting online conversions: Customers get the confidence they need to complete their purchases, reducing cart abandonment.\r\n* Enhancing customer satisfaction and loyalty: By helping customers find products that actually work for their goals, the Virtual Budtender keeps them coming back.\r\n* Saving you money: Fewer calls and emails to your staff mean more time for them to focus on in-store customers and operations.\r\nIt’s like bringing the expertise and personal touch of your best in-store budtender into your online storefront, ensuring your customers are cared for no matter where they shop.\r\nWhy This Matters Now\r\nConsumers expect more from their shopping experiences, and retailers face mounting pressure to deliver seamless, personalized service both in-store and online. Personalized e-commerce isn’t just an option anymore - it’s a necessity, and the stakes are high.\r\nE-commerce Trends in Cannabis:\r\n* Increased demand for seamless, interactive online shopping: Customers are used to intuitive digital experiences in other industries and expect the same from cannabis retailers.\r\n* Convergence on personalization: Shoppers don’t just want to browse; they want tailored recommendations that meet their unique needs and goals.\r\n* The importance of standing out: In a crowded marketplace, differentiation is key to retaining customers and growing revenue.\r\nThe Challenges Dispensaries Face:\r\n* Limited capacity for personalized online recommendations: While in-store budtenders can provide tailored guidance, online shoppers often have to navigate product choices alone, leading to frustration and indecision.\r\n* High cart abandonment rates: Without expert advice, many customers abandon their carts, unsure if they’ve made the right selection.\r\n* The missing online budtender: In-store, your staff helps customers feel confident and cared for. But online? Most dispensaries lack the tools to recreate that experience.\r\nJointly’s Virtual Budtender offers customers the personalized guidance they crave and ensures that your online presence is just as impactful as your in-store experience. With this tool, you’re not just keeping up with trends - you’re setting the standard.\r\nThe Power Behind the Virtual Budtender\r\nWhat makes the Virtual Budtender revolutionary isn’t just the technology - it’s the intelligence and insight driving every recommendation. At its core is Jointly’s unmatched data ecosystem, built from real-world experiences and refined for accuracy and trust.\r\nData-Driven Technology:\r\n* Powered by millions of data points: Since 2020, hundreds of thousands of cannabis consumers have shared their experiences through the Jointly app, creating the only comprehensive database of cannabis product performance.\r\n* Goal-specific product performance data: Recommendations aren’t random or based on anecdotes about chemistry - they’re based on how products perform for specific consumer goals, like better sleep, stress relief, or enhanced focus.\r\n* Flavor and aroma insights: With consumer feedback on terpene profiles, taste, and overall product enjoyment, the Virtual Budtender ensures that recommendations match both the desired effect and personal preference.\r\n* AI insights informed by consumer reflections: Every suggestion is grounded in real people’s lived experiences, not marketing hype or guesswork. It’s the wisdom of the crowd at work.\r\nWhy This Matters:\r\n* The cannabis market is vast and complex. Without guidance, customers often feel overwhelmed and make choices based on superficial factors like THC percentage or price.\r\n* Jointly’s Virtual Budtender demystifies this complexity by combining cutting-edge AI with authentic, goal-specific data. This ensures every recommendation helps your customers find products that truly work for them.\r\nThis is more than just AI - it’s a trusted guide, empowering customers with knowledge and making your dispensary the go-to source for expert cannabis advice, both in-store and online.\r\nWhere We’re Heading\r\nThe future of cannabis retail is here, and it’s being shaped by tools like the Virtual Budtender. As customer expectations evolve, so must the ways dispensaries deliver value. AI-driven solutions are no longer a luxury - they’re becoming essential for staying competitive.\r\nVision for the Future:\r\n* E-commerce budtenders as essential as in-store budtenders: Just as your staff helps customers navigate your physical store, the Virtual Budtender provides the same personalized, expert guidance online. Soon, this will be the baseline expectation for cannabis e-commerce.\r\n* Elevating the cannabis shopping experience: With data-driven insights and goal-specific recommendations, the Virtual Budtender ensures your customers feel confident, supported, and satisfied with their purchases.\r\nJointly’s Role in Driving This Change: At Jointly, we see a world where dispensaries are equipped with the best tools to serve their customers, both in-store and online. By pioneering innovations like the Virtual Budtender, we’re empowering retailers to lead this transformation and thrive in a competitive, rapidly growing industry.\r\nThe question isn’t whether cannabis retail will evolve - it’s how your dispensary will stay ahead of the curve. With the Virtual Budtender, you’re not just keeping up; you’re setting the standard.\r\nCall to Action\r\nThe Virtual Budtender isn’t just an idea - it’s a reality that’s already transforming dispensaries. \r\nImagine this tool on your website: customized to your brand, seamlessly integrated with your inventory, and powered by millions of real consumer data points. Your customers ask questions, and the Virtual Budtender provides personalized, data-backed answers, guiding them to the perfect product every time.

    "content": "﻿Proving the Theory of Purposeful Cannabis Consumption - Part 1 of 6\r\nIntroduction\r\n\r\n\r\n[a]\r\nThe stigma against cannabis is dying a well-deserved death. My purpose in this series is to lend a hand in defeating the stigma once and for all - using data, logic, and mathematics. I will propose four hypotheses based on the same, that lead to laws that form a new theory. \r\n\r\n\r\nThat theory, the Theory of Purposeful Cannabis Consumption, is a framework meant to free the modern cannabis consumer to pursue the better life that is possible through purposeful consumption, without guilt or prejudice.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe stigma\r\n\r\n\r\nFor decades in America (and to this day), cannabis use was demonized. Cannabis consumers were stigmatized. Growers, sellers, and consumers of cannabis were made into criminals. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe stigma posits that cannabis consumers are not productive members of society. The stigma suggests that cannabis consumers are not good mothers, fathers, friends, teachers, or employees. \r\n\r\n\r\nCannabis, according to the stigma, makes you less. \r\n\r\n\r\nFor our purposes here, we’ll express the stigma this way: \r\nYou + Cannabis < You (read as: “you plus cannabis is less than you”)\r\n\r\n\r\nSome helpful definitions\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is not a scholarly or scientific article, but I will borrow from science to make my argument. Let’s define “fact” “hypothesis” “law” and “theory” in the context of this series.\r\n\r\n\r\nFact: An observation that’s been confirmed so many times that one can accept it as “true.” (true in quotes because science always leaves room for new evidence)\r\n* Example: Nancy Reagan was First Lady of the United States in the 80s.\r\n\r\n\r\nHypothesis: A tentative explanation about an observation that can be tested.\r\n* Example: The stigma. You + Cannabis < You\r\n\r\n\r\nLaw: A description of how some aspect of the world behaves, usually involving math. It explains how, but not why.\r\n* Example: Newton’s first law of motion. An object at rest will remain at rest and an object in motion will stay in motion unless it is acted on by an unbalanced force.\r\n(This one is especially important because when I say “laws” of consumption I mean things that are true and proven about it - not that there are laws about how you should consume.)\r\n\r\n\r\nTheory: An explanation of some aspect of the world that’s well-substantiated by facts, tested hypotheses, and laws.\r\n* Example: Darwin’s Theory of Evolution by Natural Selection\r\n\r\n\r\nHow we will defeat the stigma with data\r\n\r\n\r\nThe stigma -  “You + Cannabis < You” - is a hypothesis. It is not supported by sufficient evidence. Propaganda is not proof. \r\n\r\n\r\nTo disprove it, we will prove that the opposite is true. What is the opposite?\r\nYou + Cannabis > You (read as: “you plus cannabis is greater than you”)\r\n\r\n\r\nI’ll propose 4 new hypotheses to replace the stigma’s false and misleading hypothesis:\r\n1. Cannabis is a complex plant that produces a variety of effects\r\n2. People use cannabis for many different productive purposes\r\n3. Cannabis affects each person differently\r\n4. People realize their goals more often when they create the conditions for a good experience \r\n\r\n\r\nWe will prove these hypotheses are true with data. We will elevate them to laws, together. The result will be the logical and mathematical end to the stigma and its replacement by the Theory of Purposeful Cannabis Consumption. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe proof that cannabis, consumed purposefully, makes you more, not less.\r\n  \r\n\r\nA call to action for a new language and conversation about cannabis as wellness\r\n\r\n\r\nBecause of the stigma, we have become culturally ignorant of humanity’s existence-long relationship with plant medicine. We lack a common language for talking about the benefits of cannabis. \r\n\r\n\r\nToday’s distinction between “medical” and “recreational” cannabis programs contributes to our continued misunderstanding. Medical cannabis, to many, implies that cannabis is used in treatment of a condition. This is partially true, but limiting and misleading. Recreational cannabis, likewise, implies that non-medical cannabis consumption is about fun or partying. While this is also partially true, it is again limiting and misleading. I will explain why.\r\n\r\nBy proving the four Laws of Purposeful Cannabis Consumption, my aim is to help create a common language for moving the subject forward. \r\n\r\nThis presentation is not just about the data to destigmatize. Not just about removing a stigma. It’s about elevating cannabis to its proper place in its relationship with humanity. \r\n\r\n\r\nCannabis, consumed purposefully, can be a partner in our wellbeing. We have the data to prove it.\r\n\r\n\r\nProving that your cannabis habit is a healthy one\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I started using cannabis in 2012, I didn’t tell anyone about it other than my partner and closest friends. \r\n\r\n\r\nWhy did I not consume cannabis until 2012? When I was 37 years old? Why did I not tell anyone about it? I grew up with the stigma firmly ingrained. I believed that cannabis had a negative impact on people’s lives. I considered myself a high performer. An athlete. Successful in work and business. Active. Now I was “using drugs”? It didn’t fit. All drugs are bad, right?\r\n\r\n\r\nI kept my cannabis consumption hidden from view. What if people found out I was a “stoner”? What would they think? What would it say about me?\r\n\r\n\r\nThrough cannabis, I found better wellbeing, better sleep, better health, improved relationships, free-flowing creativity, improved focus, and surprising victories in a long battle with social anxiety. \r\n\r\n\r\nHowever, at the same time, I felt guilty.\r\n\r\n\r\nI now understand that I was not alone in feeling that way. There are 50 million cannabis consumers in the US. That’s out of 260 million adults. We’ll call it 1 in 5 that have consumed cannabis in the last year. \r\n\r\n\r\nA brief thought experiment \r\n\r\n\r\nHow many people do you know, in total? On average, your answer will be about 600 people. Next: How many of them do you know use cannabis? Not 1 in 5, I bet. That would be 120 people. Look at your friends list on Facebook or wherever you inventory your friends these days. Which 20% of them are the stoners? \r\n\r\n(The success of this mini thought experiment will vary depending on your age, geography, and the religion of your parents - some groups of people are more open, others are not.)\r\n\r\n\r\nCannabis consumers are all around us. They are your friends, your co-workers, your neighbors, your teachers, your boss, the people working for you, the people at your church. \r\n\r\n\r\nThey’re all around us. They just don’t talk about it.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCannabis consumers - here’s the good news: We have the data to prove that your cannabis habit can be a healthy one. You already understand that cannabis is additive to your life. You know that when you get high, that’s not all that you are. We have the data to prove that you’re right. The data to free you from any lingering guilt. To accept yourself. Because cannabis, consumed purposefully, makes you more, not less. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy should you listen to me? \r\n\r\n\r\nFirst, a disclaimer. I am not:\r\n* a scientist\r\n* a medical professional\r\n* an expert on mental health\r\n* a plant biologist\r\n* trained in human physiology or psychology \r\n\r\n\r\nWhy listen, then? After being that kid in your Statistics class who enjoyed it and wanted more, I’ve spent most of my 25-year career using data to solve problems. Putting that to work in cannabis, together with the team at Jointly, we have created a data-driven framework for helping people discover the better life that is possible through purposeful cannabis consumption.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith gratitude and respect for the people who have been fighting this battle against the stigma long before I got here, I’m happy to report that, together with our community of over 250,000 users, Jointly has built the data set that proves that these new 4 hypotheses are true. I have an obligation to share and synthesize the data. The data prove that the voices who have been calling for legalization, de-stigmatization, and acceptance have been right all along. \r\n\r\n\r\nAs a trained statistician, I do feel qualified to say this: The stigma is statistically significant bullshit. (See, I told you this wasn’t going to be scholarly.)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe 6 parts of this series\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease forgive me for breaking this up into 6 parts. It’s too many words for a single article. A better writer could have fit it into fewer pages. You’re stuck with me. Here are the 6 parts:\r\n1. Introduction: Setting up the purpose (hello and welcome and thank you for reading)\r\n2. Plant: Cannabis is a complex plant that produces a variety of effects\r\n3. Purposes: People use cannabis for many different productive purposes\r\n4. People: Cannabis affects each person differently\r\n5. Conditions: People realize their goals more often when they create the conditions for a good experience\r\n6. Conclusion: Elevation to the Theory of Purposeful Cannabis Consumption\r\n\r\n\r\nI welcome criticism. I welcome opposing views. As a good Bayesian, I am happy to update my positions when presented with new information. \r\n\r\n\r\nThank you for your time and I hope you find something useful here. Please share it with your friends who consume cannabis. Please share it with a skeptic.\r\n\r\n\r\nA note about people 21 and under\r\n\r\nCannabis is not for children. There is good evidence that cannabis is bad for brain development. \r\n\r\n\r\nAnd, if any children have wandered here into Jointly Magazine, here’s my message for you: You only get one brain, kids. No matter what else happens in life, you’re gonna need that brain. Enjoy the joys of childhood. Let purposeful cannabis consumption be one of the joys of adulthood. And, while I’m at it: I understand childhood is hard. If there is anything that is hard for you - and anything that is hurting you, talk to someone about it. There are people who want to help.\r\n\r\n\r\n(Note: there are certain cases where doctors and parents decide that the risks from cannabis do not outweigh the benefits for a given child. Circumstances vary, but it is usually having to do with the apparent ability of cannabis to control seizures. Also, this use is typically about CBD, the less offensive cannabinoid.) \r\n________________\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nProving the Theory of Purposeful Cannabis Consumption - Part 2 of 6\r\nThe 1st Law: Cannabis Is A Complex Plant That Produces a Variety of Effects\r\n\r\n\r\nWelcome to Part 2 in this series. My purpose in this series is to lend a hand in defeating the stigma against cannabis consumption once and for all - using Jointly’s unique data - and supported by outside data sources, logic, and mathematics. \r\n\r\n\r\nIn defeating the stigma, I also aim to replace it with something better - the Theory of Purposeful Cannabis Consumption - that provides a framework for a new mindset about cannabis, supported by data and grounded in reality. \r\n\r\n\r\n1. Introduction: Setting up the purpose\r\n2. Plant: Cannabis is a complex plant that produces a variety of effects\r\n3. Purposes: People use cannabis for many different productive purposes\r\n4. People: Cannabis affects each person differently\r\n5. Conditions: People realize their goals more often when they create the conditions for a good experience\r\n6. Conclusion: Elevation to the Theory of Purposeful Cannabis Consumption\r\n\r\n\r\nThe 1st Law - Cannabis Is A Complex Plant That Produces a Variety of Effects\r\n\r\n\r\nWeed is not weed. Marijuana is not marijuana. Cannabis is not one uniform entity. It is a complex plant made of over 400 different phytochemicals (def: bioactive nutrient plant chemicals). Around 60 of these chemicals are cannabinoid compounds, some with opposing effects. \r\n\r\n\r\nTerpenes and other phenolic compounds also contribute to the plant’s complexity and varying effects. We won’t get into plant biology / chemistry here as others have done so extensively. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe above is well-known in the cannabis industry and among educated consumers. However, because of the stigma and our resulting cultural ignorance, cannabis is misunderstood. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe varying effects of cannabis are easily observable and have been studied to some extent. Below are some. For now, statements like these can be considered hypotheses:\r\n\r\nTHC stimulates appetite\r\nTHC induces feelings of euphoria\r\nTHC causes spontaneous laughter \r\nTHC enhances creativity\r\nCBD reduces inflammation\r\nCBD induces calm\r\nCBN improves sleep\r\nCBG increases energy levels\r\nCBG reduces stress\r\nMyrcene reduces inflammation\r\nMyrcene reduces pain\r\nMyrcene improves sleep\r\nPinene boosts energy levels\r\nPinene improves mental focus\r\nPinene reduces inflammation\r\nLimonene  reduces anxiety\r\nLimonene reduces stress\r\nLinalool reduces stress\r\nLinalool reduces anxiety\r\nHumulene reduces pain\r\n\r\n\r\n(this is an incomplete list, but enough to show the possibilities)\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is some evidence to suggest that these are true. More study is needed.\r\n\r\n\r\nModern cannabis products are made of one or any combination of these cannabinoids and terpenes. For some products, strain classification systems attempt to approximate the effects that a given variety of the cannabis plant will produce. \r\n\r\n\r\nCannabis plants are often processed, to reduce them to their component parts - and then the component parts can be further refined and are reassembled into products intended to produce a desired effect.\r\n\r\nJointly’s data validate the varying effects from cannabis and their different combinations of cannabinoids and terpenes. On the Jointly platform, consumers of cannabis track their consumption in pursuit of the benefits provided by cannabis. Consumers select their purpose from a list of 12 goals - including stress relief, relaxation, improved sleep, focus, creativity, and the easing of pain. They rate the products they consume for their effectiveness at providing their desired experience. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe conclusion from over 200,000 experiences? Product choice impacts the effectiveness of a cannabis experience by 40-57%. The data show clearly that there are products that perform better in statistically significant ways for specific purposes, while those same products perform worse than others for other purposes. The product that helps you sleep better is not the one that stimulates your creativity.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf note, the 40-57% difference is across populations of people and products where we can prove statistically significant differences in product performance. For those that were doing more fun things than paying attention in statistics class - all that means is that we have enough goal-specific ratings from enough people to know that the differences in product performance are because of the product. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe variance at an individual level can be even more severe. The right product can help a person unlock a new level of relaxation. The wrong product can induce panic or paranoia. \r\n\r\n\r\nProduct choice matters - because products produce varying effects. \r\n\r\n\r\nA note of caution to cannabis consumers: Be careful how you choose your products. If you choose your product because of a celebrity endorsement or because you like the packaging or a billboard, beware.\r\n\r\n\r\nJointly is building data sets to predict which cannabinoid and terpene combinations most effectively provide the desired effects. We’re building tools to match people to products, based on data about which products are most likely to provide them with the kind of experience they’re after. \r\n\r\n\r\nFor now, we’ll settle for the 1st Law of Purposeful Cannabis Consumption:\r\n\r\n\r\nCannabis is a complex plant that produces a variety of effects\r\n________________\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nProving the Theory of Purposeful Cannabis Consumption - Part 3 of 6\r\nThe 2nd Law: People Use Cannabis For Many Different Productive Purposes\r\n\r\n\r\nWelcome to Part 3 in this series. My purpose in this series is to lend a hand in defeating the stigma against cannabis consumption once and for all - using Jointly’s unique data - and supported by outside data sources, logic, and mathematics. \r\n\r\n\r\nIn defeating the stigma, I also aim to replace it with something better - the Theory of Purposeful Cannabis Consumption - that provides a framework for a new mindset about cannabis, supported by data and grounded in reality. \r\n\r\n\r\n1. Introduction: Setting up the purpose\r\n2. Plant: Cannabis is a complex plant that produces a variety of effects\r\n3. Purposes: People use cannabis for many different productive purposes\r\n4. People: Cannabis affects each person differently\r\n5. Conditions: People realize their goals more often when they create the conditions for a good experience\r\n6. Conclusion: Elevation to the Theory of Purposeful Cannabis Consumption\r\n\r\n\r\nThe 2nd Law - People Use Cannabis For Many Different Productive Purposes\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore we get into the productive reasons why people use cannabis, let’s start by agreeing on what makes a person “more.” What are the ways in which people improve their wellbeing? What are the ways we can take yourself  in your current state - and move yourself to a new and better state. Here are some ways:\r\n\r\n\r\nYou + Relaxation > You (again, read as “you plus relaxation is greater than you”)\r\nYou + Exercise > You\r\nYou + Doing something creative > You\r\nYou + Focusing > You\r\nYou + Being with people you love > You\r\nYou + Being places you love > You\r\nYou + Eating healthy food > You\r\nYou + Intimacy > You\r\nYou + Good sleep > You\r\nYou + Learning something new > You\r\nYou + Proper hydration > You\r\n\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking, you take yourself and add any of the above - and you usually end up with a better self. I would call these roughly the “additive” ways of improving your wellbeing.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can also improve your wellbeing with the reduction or removal of a negative. We’ll state it this way:\r\n\r\nYou + Pain < You (“you plus pain is less than you”)\r\nYou + Alcohol < You (sometimes)\r\nYou + Harmful Drugs < You\r\nYou + Stress < You\r\nYou + Poor Sleep < You\r\n\r\n\r\nSo, if you reduce or remove the negative, you become more.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe could argue small points here or get into data that supports each of the above, but I’ll trust we’re generally in agreement on the above.\r\n\r\n\r\nPeople Use Cannabis For Many Different Productive Purposes\r\n\r\n\r\nThe stigma taught us that cannabis is about “getting high.” \r\n\r\n\r\nIt’s not. \r\n\r\n\r\nIn a 2022 survey by New Frontier Data, consumers identified the reasons for their cannabis use:\r\nRelaxation - 18%\r\nReducing anxiety - 15%\r\nPain management - 15%\r\nStress relief - 13%\r\nImproving sleep - 10%\r\nEnjoying social experiences - 5%\r\nIncreasing overall wellness - 4%\r\nTreating a medical condition - 4%\r\nAppetite stimulation - 2%\r\nStimulating creativity - 2%\r\nImproving focus - 1%\r\n\r\n\r\nDo you see any ignoble aims in that list? Perhaps the evil is in the 5% who use cannabis to enjoy social experiences? The stigma taught us that cannabis was a party drug. However, when you talk to consumers who use cannabis to enjoy social experiences, they more often talk about their social anxiety and how cannabis helps the conversation flow more freely and naturally, unencumbered. Or, they talk about how cannabis helps them be present in the moment to enjoy experiences with their family, partner, or children.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the Jointly platform, when asked to track their consumption, users are provided with 11 options. Here is what they select:\r\nRelax & Refresh - 22%\r\nRelieve Everyday Stress - 19%\r\nImprove Sleep - 11%\r\nEnergize & Uplift - 10%\r\nEase Everyday Pain - 9%\r\nEnjoy Social Experiences - 7%\r\nFocus & Create - 7%\r\nStimulate Appetite - 6%\r\nEnhance Intimacy - 3%\r\nRecover From Exercise - 3%\r\nOther - 3%\r\n\r\n\r\nI’d like to, in particular, call your attention to that “other” option. Only 3%! Maybe evil that supports the stigma is buried there?\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother 2022 Harris Poll revealed that 91% of adults who have used cannabis did so for health and wellness purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\nI think we’ve arrived at the 2nd Law Law of Purposeful Cannabis Consumption:\r\n\r\n\r\nPeople use cannabis for many different productive purposes\r\n________________\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nProving the Theory of Purposeful Cannabis Consumption - Part 4 of 6\r\nThe 3rd Law: Cannabis Affects Each Person Differently\r\n\r\n\r\nWelcome to Part 4 in this article series. My purpose in this series is to lend a hand in defeating the stigma against cannabis consumption once and for all - using Jointly’s unique data - and supported by outside data sources, logic, and mathematics. \r\n\r\n\r\nIn defeating the stigma, I also aim to replace it with something better - the Theory of Purposeful Cannabis Consumption - that provides a framework for a new mindset about cannabis, supported by data and grounded in reality. \r\n\r\n\r\n1. Introduction: Setting up the purpose\r\n2. Plant: Cannabis is a complex plant that produces a variety of effects\r\n3. Purposes: People use cannabis for many different productive purposes\r\n4. People: Cannabis affects each person differently\r\n5. Conditions: People realize their goals more often when they create the conditions for a good experience\r\n6. Conclusion: Elevation to the Theory of Purposeful Cannabis Consumption\r\n\r\n\r\nThe 3rd Law - Cannabis Affects Each Person Differently\r\n\r\n\r\nThe best product for me is not necessarily the best product for you. It depends on your purpose. It also depends on our unique bodies and minds.\r\n\r\n\r\nInside each of our bodies is an endocannabinoid system. If you haven’t heard of it, it could be because it wasn’t discovered until 1992. You can read about it here and in other places so I won’t try to describe it in detail. Humans aren’t the only species with this system. It appears to be present in all vertebrate animals as well as some invertebrates. Here’s the definition from Wikipedia:\r\n\r\n\r\nThe endocannabinoid system is a biological system composed of endocannabinoids, which are endogenous lipid-based retrograde neurotransmitters that bind to cannabinoid receptors (CBRs), and cannabinoid receptor proteins that are expressed throughout the vertebrate central nervous system (including the brain) and peripheral nervous system\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is a system that naturally exists in your body. Science is only beginning to understand it, but its  function relates to memory, appetite, energy balance, metabolism, stress response, the immune system, ability to feel pain, and sleep.\r\n\r\nLong story short about your endocannabinoid system: Similar molecules that power your endo (inside your body) cannabinoid system are found in the cannabis plant. These are the same cannabinoids that we learned about in Part 3, which produce varying effects.\r\n\r\nInteresting, but why are we talking about it here? Well, it seems like everybody’s endocannabinoid system is a little bit different. Like a fingerprint. So, when a person consumes a certain combination and quantity of cannabinoids, the effect is likely to be personal, or shared across sets of people with similar endocannabinoid systems. \r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJointly’s data also confirm this. Product performance is not uniform across people. Different formulations of products and strains perform differently for different people. There are truths across populations, genders, and ages, but between individuals there is great variety. \r\n\r\n\r\nThis is why asking your friend about their favorite cannabis product won’t necessarily get you the kind of experience you’re after. Their opinion is a data point. To make informed product choices, it’s best to know which products are performing well across a population of people who are after the same experience as you. At Jointly, we’re happy to be working on solutions to just this problem.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis 3rd Law of Purposeful Cannabis Consumption is fairly straightforward:\r\n\r\nCannabis affects each person differently\r\n________________\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nProving the Theory of Purposeful Cannabis Consumption - Part 5 of 6\r\nThe 4rd Law: People Realize Their Goals More Often When They Create the Conditions for a Good Experience\r\n\r\n\r\nWelcome to Part 5 in this series. My purpose in this series is to lend a hand in defeating the stigma against cannabis consumption once and for all - using Jointly’s unique data - and supported by outside data sources, logic, and mathematics. \r\n\r\n\r\nIn defeating the stigma, I also aim to replace it with something better - the Theory of Purposeful Cannabis Consumption - that provides a framework for a new mindset about cannabis, supported by data and grounded in reality. \r\n\r\n\r\n1. Introduction: Setting up the purpose\r\n2. Plant: Cannabis is a complex plant that produces a variety of effects\r\n3. Purposes: People use cannabis for many different productive purposes\r\n4. People: Cannabis affects each person differently\r\n5. Conditions: People realize their goals more often when they create the conditions for a good experience\r\n6. Conclusion: Elevation to the Theory of Purposeful Cannabis Consumption\r\n\r\n\r\nThe 4th Law - People realize their goals more often when they create the conditions for a good experience\r\n\r\n\r\nIn parts 2 through 4, we’ve established that cannabis product performance varies, that people use cannabis for productive purposes, and that cannabis affects each person differently.\r\n\r\n\r\nNext, we have to ask: How is that going for people? Are they improving their wellbeing with cannabis? Are they finding success?\r\n\r\nLooking back at that 2022 New Frontier Data study. In that study, 81% of consumers say that cannabis has had a “very positive” or “somewhat positive” impact on their lives, 13% mixed positive & negative, 5% no impact, and < 2% “somewhat negative” or “very negative.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThat same study shows that for consumers using cannabis for treatment of specific conditions: 57% report their condition improved significantly, 36% said it improved slightly, 5% said it stayed the same, and 1% said it got worse.\r\n\r\nNot bad.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the Jointly platform, people report success at achieving the purposes for which they are using cannabis. On a scale of 1-10 for product performance, the average rating is between 6.5 and 7.0.\r\n\r\nHowever, the ratings also vary between 1 and 10. Results are inconsistent. Why is this? Our data show that there are at least 15 factors that impact a person’s experience with cannabis. We’ve touched on a few of them: purpose, product, and your unique endocannabinoid system.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat are the other factors? They are things like dose, time between doses, ingestion method, whether your stomach is empty or full, the setting, and the company you keep. This may sound familiar as people have been talking about mindset and setting for quite some time now.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs a cannabis consumer discovers how to create the conditions for the kind of experience they’re after, their results improve. Jointly’s data confirm this. Factors that aren’t about product and dose can improve perceived product performance by about 40-50%, depending on the goal. \r\n\r\n\r\nIt’s simple: By creating the right conditions, you can get better results.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout side effects and negative effects\r\n\r\n\r\nCannabis consumption can also come with unwanted or unintended effects: dry mouth, red-eye, disorientation, dizziness, slow reaction time, impaired movement, memory issues, drowsiness, paranoia, and the munchies.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome of these can be caused by misunderstandings. A person using cannabis to focus who experiences drowsiness may be using the wrong product. Or the wrong dose. Plus, one person’s drowsiness as a side effect could be another person’s desired effect if their goal is improved sleep. \r\n\r\n\r\nSimilarly, some consumers may not want the munchies, but for others appetite stimulation is their objective. This is a common use for cancer patients and others needing more calories.\r\n\r\n\r\nCannabis is a case where more is often not better. Frequent users can develop a tolerance to the effects, motivating them to consume more in pursuit of their desired effects. Finding your ideal dose is a personal journey that varies by person and their desired experience. Less is often more.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost cannabinoids have a bi-phasic effect - meaning that a small dose could reduce anxiety, while a larger dose could induce anxiety.\r\n\r\nNot for everyone\r\n\r\nConsumers on the Jointly platform track the incidence of side effects and can find products, doses, and methods to reduce or eliminate them. Sometimes people are successful in doing so. Other times they are not. Cannabis is not for everyone. \r\n\r\n\r\nMuch pro-cannabis content online ignores the fact that cannabis is not for everyone. It doesn't work all the time. It can negatively impact people's lives, but - theoretically - anything can. You can ruin your back deadlifting, or destroy your ankle running, but for most people that doesn't mean you shouldn't exercise. You just need to find the right exercise (or cannabis product) for you. Dabbing THC is like powerlifting. A CBD gummy is like going for a walk around the block.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNot for kids\r\n\r\n\r\nAs mentioned in the first part of this series, cannabis is not for children. There is good evidence that cannabis is bad for brain development. \r\n\r\n\r\nI’ll repeat: If any children have wandered here into Jointly Magazine, here’s my message for you: You only get one brain, kids. Enjoy the joys of childhood. Let purposeful cannabis consumption be one of the joys of adulthood. And, while I’m at it: I understand childhood is hard. If there is anything that is hard for you - and anything that is hurting you, talk to someone about it. There are people who want to help you.\r\n\r\n\r\n(Note: there are certain cases where doctors and parents decide that the risks from cannabis do not outweigh the benefits for that specific child, usually having to do with the apparent ability of cannabis to control seizures, and also usually about CBD, the less offensive cannabinoid.). \r\n\r\n\r\nOveruse\r\n\r\n\r\nTo prove how safe cannabis use can be, people like to say that no one has ever died of a cannabis overdose. \r\n\r\n\r\nWhile that is comforting and makes cannabis seem a helluva lot safer than most drugs, we don’t yet have a clear picture of the long term impacts of cannabis use. \r\n\r\n\r\nWe need more data. Until we have that data, I’d advise caution. \r\n\r\n\r\nWatch your tolerance. Take breaks when possible. Find the ways of getting the experience you’re after with a smaller dose. Watch for signs of dependency. If your cannabis consumption is harming your relationships, work, health, or family, that’s not purposeful consumption. Make sure cannabis remains a force for good in your life.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo conclude: If people are successful at using cannabis for productive purposes, and they report improvement when they create the right conditions, I think we’ve arrived at our 4th law: \r\n\r\n\r\nPeople realize their goals more often when they create the conditions for a good experience\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nProving the Theory of Purposeful Cannabis Consumption - Part 6 of 6\r\nConclusion: The Theory of Purposeful Consumption\r\n\r\n\r\nWelcome to the conclusion of this series. My purpose in this series was to lend a hand in defeating the stigma against cannabis consumption once and for all - using Jointly’s unique data - and supported by outside data sources, logic, and mathematics. How am I doing?\r\n\r\n\r\nIn defeating the stigma, I also aim to replace it with something better - the Theory of Purposeful Cannabis Consumption - that provides a framework for a new mindset about cannabis, supported by data and grounded in reality. \r\n\r\n\r\n1. Introduction: Setting up the purpose\r\n2. Plant: Cannabis is a complex plant that produces a variety of effects\r\n3. Purposes: People use cannabis for many different productive purposes\r\n4. People: Cannabis affects each person differently\r\n5. Conditions: People realize their goals more often when they create the conditions for a good experience\r\n6. Conclusion: Elevation to the Theory of Purposeful Cannabis Consumption\r\n\r\n\r\nThis article is about that theory.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Theory of Purposeful Cannabis Consumption\r\n\r\n\r\nTo review, these are the 4 laws of Purposeful Consumption:\r\n\r\nPlant: Cannabis is a complex plant that produces a variety of effects\r\nPurposes: People use cannabis for many different productive purposes\r\nPeople: Cannabis affects each person differently\r\nConditions: People realize their goals more often when they create the conditions for a good experience\r\n\r\n\r\nWe’ve proven these with data.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs a reminder, we’ve expressed the stigma this way: \r\nYou + Cannabis < You (read as: “you plus cannabis is less than you”)\r\n\r\nWith the establishment of these 4 new laws, we can assert:\r\nYou + Cannabis > You (read as: “you plus cannabis is greater than you”)\r\n\r\n\r\nCannabis, consumed purposefully, makes you more, not less.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo the stigma is gone, at least mathematically. And we’ve got four new laws we can use to understand our reality. But the stigma still persists in the real world. People are still in jail for selling and consuming cannabis. People are prevented from working in certain jobs and professions. There is much to do, but at least the math is done.\r\n\r\n\r\nNext: Let’s take things a step further to get from the 4 Laws to the Theory.\r\n\r\n\r\nTake those 4 laws and add this: \r\nCannabis pairs best with a healthy lifestyle.\r\n\r\n\r\nGoing back to these:\r\nYou + Relaxation > You (again, read as “you plus relaxation is greater than you”)\r\nYou + Exercise > You\r\nYou + Being with people you love > You\r\nYou + Being places you love > You\r\nYou + Eating healthy food > You\r\nYou + Good sleep > You\r\nYou + Proper Hydration > You\r\n\r\n\r\nThose same factors that make you a better you also make for a better cannabis experience. When you’re generally making good healthy lifestyle choices, you’ll enjoy your cannabis more. \r\n\r\n\r\nIt’s a virtuous circle. A recipe for better living. Because the following statements are also true, when you create the right conditions:\r\n\r\n\r\nRelaxation + Cannabis > Relaxation\r\nExercise + Cannabis > Exercise\r\nCreating + Cannabis > Creating\r\nFocusing + Cannabis > Focusing\r\nBeing with people you love + Cannabis  > Being with people you love\r\nBeing places you love  + Cannabis > Being places you love\r\nEnjoying healthy food  + Cannabis > Enjoying healthy food\r\nIntimacy  + Cannabis > Intimacy\r\nGood sleep  + Cannabis > Good sleep\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThat’s the Theory of Purposeful Consumption.\r\nCannabis, consumed purposefully, makes you more, not less.\r\nA healthy lifestyle supports a good cannabis experience.\r\nA good cannabis experience supports a healthy lifestyle.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis plant and us. We are meant to go together. Or so the data seem to suggest.\r\n\r\n\r\nNote: This Theory is not new. Humanity has understood purpose-driven, plant-based medicine for thousands of years. We just up and forgot about it - and are just now beginning to find our way home.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne more note: Even after 6 parts, this presentation has deliberately left out subjects like cannabis and self-discovery, cannabis and self-acceptance, cannabis and becoming more open, and how cannabis helps connect you to people, places, and moments. I don’t think we can quantify those benefits. But try out purposeful consumption and I hope you’ll see what I mean. \r\n\r\n\r\nLastly: Please pardon my abuse of scientific terms. They’re devices for making a point. No disrespect intended. Although I would love for someone to say, “Purposeful consumption? That’s just a theory.”\r\n[a]Add byline.",

    "content": "﻿Lessons from a Decade in Bicycle Retail for the Cannabis Dispensary Owner\r\n\r\n\r\nBy David Kooi, CEO of Jointly and former Owner of the Santa Monica Mountains Cyclery\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom my first job at a local pool snack bar to founding one of Southern California's most successful bicycle shops, my retail journey was diverse and enlightening. My experiences have ingrained in me a respect for the art and science of retail management and taught me lessons that I now offer here - in hope that they may be of some use to you, the dispensary owner.\r\n\r\nWhile the products and customer bases differ, the core principles of retail—focusing on the customer experience and operational efficiency—remain consistent. \r\n\r\n\r\nThis article is an attempt to explore how lessons learned from one industry might translate to another, fully acknowledging that some principles may require adaptation to fit the unique context of cannabis retail. Consider these insights as a starting point for reflection and potential application to your dispensary's operations.\r\n\r\n\r\nBelieve it or not, at 5,000 words I tried to keep it brief and left out some key lessons. I may create some shorter form content if there is interest. But I’m more of a long form guy. \r\n\r\nAlso full disclosure: Jointly makes software that helps cannabis retailers sell more cannabis, and invites cannabis retailers to join our platform to be connected with a new kind of purposeful consumer, but I won’t be trying to sell you anything here. \r\n\r\nBut what I will try to convince you of: I’ve had the fortune of meeting a small sample of the amazing cast of characters that is cannabis retail today. Hearing of the less-than-excellent experiences people have had with other (but not all) cannabis tech companies over the years, I acknowledge that there is a natural (and valid and data-driven) skepticism of some new guy saying: “Hi. I’m Dave with another cannabis tech company you haven’t heard of and I’m here to help.” This article is meant to show you that I am not that guy.\r\n\r\nThere are 16 lessons. I’ll list them here first, and then describe each briefly. If you read this and want to drill down on any topic, hit me up.\r\n\r\n1. Sell Experiences, Not Products\r\n2. Focus on the Fundamentals\r\n3. Exhibit Authentic Passion\r\n4. Empower Your Team\r\n5. Know Your Math\r\n6. Own Local Search\r\n7. Harness the Power of Customer Reviews\r\n8. Build Your Own List\r\n9. Drive The Market (Don’t Be Carried By It)\r\n10. Master the Art of Upselling\r\n11. Rethink Customer Loyalty (Beyond Points and Rewards)\r\n12. Discount With Caution\r\n13. Maximize Your Space (Creating Value in Every Square Foot)\r\n14. Recover Gracefully From Errors\r\n15. Be Generous With Your People\r\n16. Monitor Your Inventory Like A Hawk\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Sell Experiences, Not Products\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Joy of the Ride\r\n\r\n\r\nIn bicycle retail, our emphasis was never solely on the product - it was about the joy and freedom that comes from riding. Our slogan was “Ride. Enjoy. Repeat.” The experience of gliding down a street, the wind in your face, reaching the summit of a climb, the exhilaration of a steep descent—these are the moments we sold. Sometimes we also just sold tubes.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was our goal that our brand became synonymous in our customers’ minds with these joyful experiences, turning customers into passionate cyclists who saw their bikes not just as tools, but as keys to adventure and a sense of community. With their local shop as their guide. \r\n\r\n\r\nEnhancing Life's Moments\r\n\r\n\r\nFor cannabis dispensaries, the principle is remarkably similar. Cannabis isn't just about the products on the shelf - it's about the experiences those products enable. Whether it's in providing relaxation, creativity, socialization, or relief, dispensaries have the opportunity to become a vital part of their customers' well-being and lifestyle. \r\n\r\n\r\nBy focusing on how cannabis can enhance life's moments, dispensaries can cultivate a community of consumers who are proud to be part of a collective journey towards wellness and enjoyment. This approach shifts the conversation from price to value, where the true worth is measured in quality of life improvements, not just dollars and cents. People are starving for connection. You have a chance to provide them with one.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Focus on the Fundamentals\r\n\r\n\r\nMastering the Essentials\r\n\r\n\r\nThere’s a lot of noise out there. Retail, when you boil away the noise, is simple. Keep it simple and focus on the basics. There are a handful of ways a retailer can grow or earn more profit:\r\n* Bring in more visitors\r\n* Reduce the cost of bringing in new visitors\r\n* Sell to a higher percentage of visitors\r\n* Sell at a higher average cart value\r\n* Sell specific products at a higher price\r\n* Sell specific products at a lower cost\r\n* Get customers to return more frequently\r\n\r\n\r\nIn bicycle retail, we learned that success doesn't necessarily come from complex strategies or the latest trends but from doing the basics exceptionally well. We focused on the above key areas to drive growth:\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Attracting New Customers: Whether through community events, local advertising, or an engaging online presence, bringing new visitors into the store, and via a diverse set of sources, was always a priority.\r\n2. Optimizing Acquisition Costs: We constantly evaluated our marketing efforts to ensure we were getting the best return on investment, aiming to reduce the cost of attracting new customers.\r\n3. Maximizing Conversion Rates: Not every visitor to the store would make a purchase, but by providing excellent service and an inviting atmosphere, we aimed to convert as many as possible and increase the odds that people would think of us instead of Amazon next time they needed something.\r\n4. Increasing Average Transaction Value: Through thoughtful product recommendations and understanding customer needs, we sought to enhance the value of each purchase.\r\n5. Improving Pricing Strategies: We balanced competitive pricing with the value provided, ensuring customers felt they were getting great value for their money.\r\n6. Reducing Operational Costs: Efficiency in operations helped us maintain profitability without compromising on quality or service.\r\n7. Encouraging Repeat Business: Building relationships with customers ensured they would return, not just for repeat purchases but for services and community events as well. Who does your customer think of first next time they have a shopping intent for cannabis and why? Give them a reason to think of you.\r\n\r\n\r\nCannabis dispensaries can apply these same principles to achieve success. The nuances of the cannabis industry, such as product diversity and regulatory compliance, add layers of complexity, but the foundational strategies remain the same.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Exhibit Authentic Passion\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Heart of Retail\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the world of bicycle retail, authenticity was non-negotiable. The most successful staff members were those who lived and breathed cycling. Their genuine passion wasn't just a part of the job - it was the soul of our business. Customers can sense authenticity from miles away, and nothing beats the trust and rapport built by sharing genuine experiences and enthusiasm for cycling. This authenticity turned transactions into conversations, customers into community members, and the bike shop into a hub of shared passions.\r\n\r\n\r\nAuthentic Connection\r\n\r\n\r\nThe same holds true in cannabis retail. Authenticity is key. A genuine appreciation and understanding of cannabis are fundamental, not just for credibility but for creating meaningful connections with customers. It's about being on the same journey as your customers, exploring and discovering the multifaceted benefits of cannabis together. This connection isn't directly about maximizing profit from each sale - it's about guiding customers to the best possible experiences with cannabis and optimizing their usage for better outcomes. By focusing on enhancing their lives, you naturally cultivate loyal customers who trust your guidance and expertise, knowing you share a common goal: to celebrate and harness the plant's potential for improved well-being and happiness.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. Empower Your Team\r\n\r\n\r\nPrecision and Efficiency\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the realm of bicycle retail, the efficiency of a mechanic's workstation could dramatically impact their effectiveness - and their job satisfaction. Every tool's placement, the layout of the work area, and even the process flow between tasks were meticulously optimized to reduce unnecessary movement and transition times. This principle extended to sales as well, where having the right inventory and being well-versed in the products' features and benefits were crucial. Effective displays and signage played a supportive role, guiding customers and facilitating smoother transactions. We reevaluated our tools, signage, and displays regularly to remove what wasn’t working and do more of what was.\r\n\r\n\r\nNavigating Complexity with Confidence\r\n\r\n\r\nCannabis retail presents its own set of challenges, mirroring the complexity of the plant itself. With a diverse array of effects and uses, coupled with individualized responses to cannabis, budtenders face a demanding task. The lack of robust, goal-specific product performance data compounds this challenge (warning: small Jointly plug coming), often leaving customers and budtenders navigating a sea of uncertainty. This is where tools like Jointly’s Spark Pro come into play, designed to demystify the cannabis buying experience by providing clear, data-driven insights into product performance and consumption best practices. By equipping your staff with such tools and knowledge, you not only streamline their workflow but also enhance their ability to guide customers towards the best choices for their needs, making the selling process not just easier, but more rewarding for everyone involved.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. Know Your Math\r\n\r\n\r\nNumbers Tell the Story\r\n\r\n\r\nIn bicycle retail, understanding the store's metrics was akin to solving a puzzle. We tracked and made visible a range of metrics like average ticket size, time spent in the store, return visit probabilities, sales by employee, sales by department, sales by brand, sales by customer segment, sales by shelf or fixture, sales by day of the week, time of the day. This quantitative approach allowed us to identify patterns and opportunities for improvement. Knowing the cost of acquiring a new customer versus retaining an existing one was crucial. Every aspect of the store's operation was examined through the lens of numbers, ensuring decisions were data-driven and aimed at optimizing both customer satisfaction and profitability.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Math of Cannabis Retail\r\n\r\n\r\nCannabis dispensaries can greatly benefit from a similar analytical approach. In a market as nuanced and diverse as cannabis, understanding your store's metrics is indispensable. This involves tracking not just sales and foot traffic but also customer behavior patterns, preferences, and feedback. Utilizing tools and software that provide real-time data and analytics can transform a dispensary's approach from reactive to proactive. By identifying the \"levers and knobs\" within your operations—such as product mix, pricing strategies, customer education efforts, and loyalty programs—you can fine-tune your business model for maximum efficiency and customer satisfaction. In essence, treating your dispensary as a dynamic math problem allows for a strategic approach that benefits everyone involved: customers get a tailored and positive experience, employees are empowered and clear on objectives, and owners see sustainable growth and profitability.\r\n\r\n\r\n6. Own Local Search\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Power of Local Search\r\n\r\n\r\nIn both bicycle and cannabis retail, dominating local search results like \"dispensary near me\" or \"bike shop near me\" is crucial. This is the starting point for most people in the digital era, making it essential for your business to secure the top spot.\r\n\r\n\r\nAchieving Local Search Success\r\n\r\n\r\nA solid local SEO strategy doesn't need to be complex. Focus on the basics:\r\n\r\n\r\n* Google My Business: Keep your listing detailed and up-to-date. High-quality photos and accurate information about your dispensary can make a significant difference.\r\n* Website Optimization: Use local keywords and create content that resonates with your community. This could include information about local events, local cannabis laws, or how your dispensary contributes to the local scene. Don’t try to compete for “What is cannabis?” - compete for “Best cannabis near me.” \r\n* Product Discoverability: Make sure Google can see/index your product pages. Write good keyword-rich descriptions.\r\n* Seek Expertise When Needed: If SEO isn't your forte, it's wise to consult with a trusted expert who can demonstrate tangible results from past work. Beware of the SEO maze - focus on practical, impactful strategies.\r\n\r\n\r\n7. Harness the Power of Customer Reviews\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Impact of Customer Feedback\r\n\r\n\r\nIn bicycle retail, we recognized early on the immense value of online reviews. We made it a practice to follow up with every customer by email, encouraging them to share their feedback and experiences. This not only bolstered our online presence but also provided invaluable insights into our strengths and areas for improvement. \r\nA Continuous Feedback Loop\r\n\r\n\r\nFor cannabis dispensaries, mastering online reviews can significantly influence customer perception and store performance. Implementing an automated system to email customers post-visit for their ratings can streamline this process. There are services that enable positive experiences to be channeled towards public review platforms (Google), while lower ratings can open a dialogue for direct feedback directly to you, allowing you to address concerns proactively.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis approach not only improves your online reputation but also creates a culture of continuous improvement within your team. Over time, this feedback loop can become a key differentiator, setting your dispensary apart from competitors on Google and fostering a loyal customer base. In the digital age, your online reputation is just as crucial as your in-store experience.\r\n\r\nAlso: There’s no way to cheat at it. You’ll end up with the best reviews in 5 years in your market by providing 5 years of excellent customer experiences.\r\n\r\n\r\n8. Build Your Own List\r\n\r\n\r\nLeveraging Customer Data for Growth\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the bicycle retail world, building a direct line of communication with our customers was key to fostering long-term relationships and repeat business. We made it a priority to collect contact information from every customer (measuring our daily and monthly “email capture rate” by employee, and rewarding those who “captured” more) and treating it as a valuable asset for personalized marketing and engagement. This practice isn't just about having a way to reach out - it's about creating a community around your brand.\r\n\r\n\r\nApplying This to Cannabis Retail\r\n\r\n\r\nFor cannabis dispensaries, the principle remains the same but becomes even more crucial due to the unique challenges and restrictions in cannabis marketing. By collecting emails and phone numbers, with a keen focus on your \"capture rate,\" you open up a direct channel to your customer base. This isn't just for sending promotional content - it's a way to educate, inform, and build a rapport with your audience.\r\n\r\n\r\nEffective Data Collection\r\n\r\n\r\nIncentivizing your staff to encourage sign-ups can significantly boost your capture rate. Nobody likes asking for a phone number or email address. Make it a part of the customer experience, explaining the benefits of staying connected, such as exclusive deals, educational content, and event invitations. Do the math on number of store visits * email capture rate * 5 years of doing it and the size of your local audience will be formidable.\r\n\r\n\r\n9. Drive The Market (Don’t Be Carried By It)\r\n\r\n\r\nDiversifying Customer Acquisition Channels\r\n\r\n\r\nIn bicycle retail, finding new customers was never a one-size-fits-all strategy. We thrived on a multi-channel approach, leveraging everything from local events and community rides to digital marketing and social media campaigns. The goal was to create a consistent and scalable model for customer acquisition that could be dialed up or down based on market conditions and business goals. There were times that we were so busy we had to turn down the knobs. There were times when we were so slow that all the knobs were turned to 11.\r\n\r\n\r\nApplying Multi-Channel Strategies in Cannabis Retail\r\n\r\n\r\nCannabis dispensaries can take a leaf from this playbook by developing a diversified strategy for attracting new customers. This involves not just relying on traditional advertising but embracing digital tools, local SEO, social media, community engagement, and educational content to reach potential customers across multiple touchpoints. Dabble in the marketplaces but don’t depend on them. But don’t completely eschew them. You’ve got to meet people where they are.\r\n\r\n\r\nLeveraging Technology\r\n\r\n\r\nTechnology plays a crucial role in scaling these efforts efficiently. Customer relationship management (CRM) systems, email marketing platforms, and analytics tools can provide valuable insights into what's working and what's not, allowing you to adjust your strategies in real-time.\r\n\r\n\r\nMastering the Market\r\n\r\n\r\nThe key is not to be passive participants in the market but to actively shape it. By understanding customer needs, staying ahead of trends, and continuously refining your acquisition strategies, you can be a market leader, not just a follower. \r\n\r\n\r\n10. Master the Art of Upselling\r\n\r\n\r\nBeyond the Basic Sale\r\n\r\n\r\nIn bicycle retail, upselling wasn't just about increasing the ticket size - it was about enhancing the customer's cycling experience. We focused on understanding the customer's needs and aspirations, which allowed us to recommend products that genuinely added value to their purchase. “Where do you like to ride?” “What hurts when you’re on a long ride?” “Is anything cold on those early AM rides?” “How old is your helmet?” “Do you ride with the family?” (you should have a list of such questions for your budtenders - and they can help you make it)\r\n\r\n\r\n Whether it was a higher-end bike that better suited their riding style or essential add-ons like helmets and lights, the goal was always to ensure the customer left with everything they needed for the best possible riding experience. Plus, every rider could use another tube. \r\n\r\nWe measured “bike add-on sales” - which was how much was added to a sales ticket when a customer bought a new bike that was above the bike price. We also measured the “work order attachment rate” - which was how much was added to a service ticket when a customer brought a bike in for a tune-up beyond the base tune-up rate. These two measurements were consistently the key drivers of the store’s success. \r\n\r\n\r\nYou can’t just let people buy what they came in for. It’s not gonna work unless you’re just really lucky.\r\n\r\nWhen a customer is in your store, you have a small amount of monopoly power over them because of the cost of going elsewhere to get the thing they needed anyway. They might as well buy it from you. You can’t succeed in retail if a customer only buys what they came in for.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut upselling is an art. If you upsell and people can feel you upselling, they’ll hate you and never come back. But if you are showing them things they didn’t know they needed - but then it makes their next ride better, they’ll thank you for it and ask you what else you recommend. \r\n\r\n\r\nUpselling in Cannabis Retail\r\n\r\n\r\nCannabis retail shares a similar opportunity for upselling, but with its unique nuances. It's not just selling more - it's about deepening the customer's cannabis experience. How many SKUs does your average visitor interact with? How many are they completely unaware of? Many customers might not be aware of the breadth of products available or how different products can meet their various needs. It’s your job to tell them.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor instance, someone using cannabis for pain relief might not be aware of the benefits of a topical cannabis-infused lotion or cream. Someone who has smoked flower for ages might not be aware of the new product categories and ingestion methods. Someone who thinks cannabis is just about getting high and is shopping for the most THC per dollar might not be aware of its myriad benefits and the nuances of minor cannabinoids, terpenes, etc. By listening, educating, and making thoughtful recommendations, budtenders can transform a simple purchase into a holistic solution - and a stranger into a loyal customer and friend.\r\n\r\n\r\nImplementing Upselling Effectively, Some Best Practices\r\n\r\n\r\n* Educate Your Team: Ensure your staff is knowledgeable about all products, their benefits, and how they complement each other. This empowers them to make informed recommendations that resonate with the customer's needs.\r\n* Understand Your Customer: Engage in genuine conversations to understand why they use cannabis and what they hope to achieve. This insight allows for personalized upselling that feels natural and helpful. Get budtenders to ask open ended questions.\r\n* Highlight the Value: Frame upselling as a way to enhance the customer's experience. It's not about spending more - it's about getting more value and enjoyment from their purchase.\r\n* Be Sensitive to Signals: Pay attention to the customer's reactions. Upselling should feel like a service, not a sales pitch. If a customer seems uninterested or hesitant, respect their stance and don't push further.\r\n* Leverage Data: Use insights (from tools provided by Jointly, there I go again) to understand what products are best suited to the various reasons why people shop for cannabis. This data-driven approach can guide your upselling strategies, making recommendations more credible and effective. Let the data make the recommendations - and then it’s your job to help the customer decide from there.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy mastering the art of upselling, you can not only increase revenue but also build trust and loyalty by consistently delivering value and enhancing the cannabis experience for your customers.\r\n\r\n\r\n11. Rethink Customer Loyalty (Beyond Points and Rewards)\r\n\r\n\r\nMileage and Trophies and Kudos Over Points\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the bicycle retail world, we discovered that traditional rewards and points programs often missed the mark in fostering true customer loyalty. Instead of incentivizing repeat visits through points accumulation, we focused on delivering dependable value on those visits. \r\n\r\n\r\nOur most successful loyalty program rewarded customers for the miles they logged, directly linking their rewards to their personal achievements and experiences. This approach resonated deeply, strengthening their connection to our brand and community, and reinforcing their love for cycling.\r\n\r\n\r\nCrafting Authentic Loyalty in Cannabis Retail\r\n\r\n\r\nCannabis dispensaries face a similar challenge in cultivating genuine loyalty. While rewards and points can offer short-term incentives, they rarely build long-lasting relationships. True loyalty emerges when customers feel a personal connection to your dispensary, not just because they're chasing discounts.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome Strategies for Meaningful Customer Engagement\r\n\r\n\r\n* Experience-Driven Loyalty: Create loyalty programs that celebrate and enhance the cannabis journey. Consider rewards that tie back to their experiences or milestones achieved with cannabis, perhaps mirroring the mileage-based approach \r\n* Personalized Engagement: Invest in getting to know your customers. Use their preferences and purchase history to personalize their experience, making each visit feel tailored and special.\r\n* Community Building: Foster a sense of community around your dispensary. Host educational events, support local causes, or create spaces where customers can share their love for cannabis.\r\n* Value-Added Services: Offer services that go beyond the transaction. This could include personalized consultations or educational workshops.\r\n* Transparent Communication: Be clear and upfront about any loyalty or rewards program you do implement. Avoid complex rules or conditions that could lead to misunderstandings or frustrations.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy focusing on these aspects, you can build a loyal customer base that returns not for points or discounts, but for the quality of service, the sense of community, and the personalized cannabis experience they receive. True loyalty is earned through consistent, genuine engagement and by providing value in every interaction. The last thing you want is to be resolving an issue with a good customer over their points balance. Ick.\r\n\r\n\r\n12. Discount With Caution\r\n\r\n\r\nSpecial Price. Just For You. Limited Time.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn bicycle retail, discounting was a tactic we used sparingly and strategically. The focus was always on the value and experience each product offered, not on competing on price. Regular discounting was seen as a slippery slope, potentially devaluing the brand and the products. Instead, discounts were reserved for specific situations, such as clearing out discontinued lines or making room for new inventory. This approach ensured that the business remained sustainable and that customers valued the products for their quality and the experiences they enabled, not just their price tags.\r\n\r\n\r\nApplying Caution to Cannabis Retail Discounts\r\n\r\n\r\nThe same principles hold true in cannabis retail. While occasional discounts can be an effective tool for inventory management or to celebrate special occasions, relying heavily on discounting can undermine the perceived value of your products and the overall brand. It's crucial to build your business on a foundation of quality, education, and customer experience. \r\n\r\nI fear for the health of the cannabis industry in this regard. Did you see the recent Dutchie report? The average discount per order in 2023 was nearly 30 percent, with 65 percent of the total orders processed including some type of discount. This makes my heart shutter for cannabis retail. We’ve got to find a way out. My favorite idea, of course, is to change the conversation and make it about purpose and product performance, taste, and aroma, not price or potency.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf regular discounting becomes necessary to move a product, it might be time to reevaluate its fit for your inventory. Sustainable success in cannabis retail comes from offering products that resonate with your customers' needs and preferences, supported by knowledgeable staff and a welcoming atmosphere, rather than competing on price alone (unless you are somehow blessed with a sustainable cost advantage, which is unlikely).\r\n\r\n\r\n13. Maximize Your Space (Creating Value in Every Square Foot)\r\n\r\n\r\nPurposeful Space Utilization\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the bicycle retail world, the effectiveness of our space was measured not just by sales per square foot but by the value each area brought to the customer experience. We recognized that not every square foot needed to directly generate revenue, but it did need to contribute to the overall value of the store. We paid our landlord per square foot so we made the space perform per square foot.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile we never added the giant fish tank I wanted so that we’d be remembered as “the bike shop with the cool fish tank” (this was a dream project of mine - the bike shop where kids would always ask their parents to go - but fish tank installation and maintenance are expensive and margins on kids bikes are not great) we did find undeniable value in providing a comfortable lounge area. This space, where companions could relax while others shopped, didn't directly sell products but significantly enhanced the shopping experience, making our store a more welcoming and enjoyable place to visit. We had free coffee and chocolates.\r\n\r\nStrategic Space Design\r\n\r\n\r\nFor cannabis dispensaries, the strategic use of space is equally crucial. Every area of your dispensary should serve a purpose, whether it's driving sales, educating customers, or simply making them feel comfortable and welcome. This could mean creating well-designed product display areas that encourage exploration and interaction, educational corners where customers can learn about cannabis and its various uses, or cozy waiting areas that make the entire shopping experience more pleasant. There are experts that can help you with this if you’re not naturally good at feng shui.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome Suggestions for Cannabis Retail Spaces\r\n\r\n\r\n* Interactive Product Displays: Use your space to create engaging and informative product displays that invite customers to explore and learn about different cannabis products and their benefits.\r\n* Education Stations: Dedicate areas for educational materials and interactive learning, helping customers make informed choices and fostering a sense of trust and reliability in your brand. Even the people who don’t use them will see that they’re there.\r\n* Comfortable Waiting Areas: Provide comfortable seating and a welcoming atmosphere for customers and their companions, making your dispensary a destination rather than just a stop. Spend some money making it feel like a place you’d want to hang out.\r\n* Themed Zones: Consider organizing your space into themed zones based on product types or effects, making it easier for customers to navigate and find what they're looking for. \r\n\r\n\r\nAlso: Reevaluate and rearrange your space often. The first thing a customer sees as they walk in should change weekly or at least monthly. By moving things around, you will find customers saying “Oh I didn’t know you sold X here” - and you’ve actually sold it for years and you just finally moved it into a place where they could find it.\r\n\r\n\r\n14. Recover Gracefully From Errors\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery business makes mistakes\r\n\r\n\r\nHow you recover from your mistakes defines who you are as a business. In bicycle retail, mistakes were inevitable, but it was our response to those mistakes that left a lasting impression on our customers. Whether it was a delayed order, a service mishap, or any other error, our focus was always on owning the issue and rectifying it with humility and generosity. This approach not only helped to resolve individual problems but also reinforced our commitment to customer satisfaction and trust.\r\n\r\n\r\nDon’t try to win the argument. Try to win the customer (and all of her friends).\r\n\r\n\r\nApplying Graceful Recovery to Cannabis Retail\r\n\r\n\r\nCannabis retail, much like any other retail sector, is not immune to errors and missteps. How your dispensary handles these situations can significantly impact customer loyalty and word-of-mouth reputation. The key is to adopt a customer-first mindset, ensuring that every resolution is geared towards not just fixing the problem but enhancing the customer's perception of your business.\r\n\r\n\r\nBest Practices for Effective Issue Resolution\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Swift Acknowledgment: Recognize and acknowledge the mistake as soon as it's brought to your attention. A prompt response demonstrates your attentiveness and commitment to customer service.\r\n2. Sincere Apology: Offer a genuine apology that conveys your understanding of the inconvenience caused. Avoid generic responses. Personalize your apology to show that you truly care.\r\n3. Take Responsibility: Own up to the error without deflecting blame. Customers appreciate transparency and accountability.\r\n4. Make Amends: Go beyond a simple apology by offering a solution or compensation that matches or exceeds the customer's expectations. This could be a discount, a free product, or any other gesture that demonstrates your commitment to making things right.\r\n5. Follow-Up: After resolving the issue, follow up with the customer to ensure they're satisfied with the outcome. This extra step can turn a dissatisfied customer into a loyal advocate.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy embracing these strategies, you can turn negative experiences into opportunities to strengthen customer relationships and build a reputation for service and integrity. In retail, graceful recovery from mistakes can be as impactful as flawless service.\r\n\r\n\r\n15. Be Generous With Your People\r\n\r\n\r\nEmbracing Employee Well-Being\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the bicycle retail business, we understood that our staff were the frontline ambassadors of our brand and the primary drivers of our customer experience. Recognizing the challenges that come with dealing with the public (especially in Los Angeles), we made it a priority to cultivate an environment of appreciation and support. Celebrating \"new bike day\" was not just a joy for customers but a moment of pride for our team, highlighting the impact of their work and dedication.\r\n\r\n\r\nTranslating Generosity to Cannabis Retail\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ethos of generosity and support is equally, if not more, vital in cannabis retail. The nuances of cannabis products, coupled with the diverse needs and questions of customers, can make the job particularly demanding. Here are some tips for how dispensaries can create a supportive and respectful workplace:\r\n\r\n\r\n* Regular Appreciation: Implement regular programs to recognize and reward your staff's hard work and dedication. This could range from employee of the month awards to team outings and public acknowledgments. We liked bowling. And shop bike rides.\r\n* Supportive Environment: Create a work culture that values open communication, feedback, and mutual respect. Ensure your team knows that their well-being is a priority and that management is always there to support them.\r\n* Customer Interactions: Stand by your team in customer interactions, especially in challenging situations. Make it clear that while customer satisfaction is crucial, employee respect and kindness are non-negotiable. Never throw your employee under the bus to resolve a customer complaint.\r\n* Training and Development: Invest in your employees' growth through ongoing training and development opportunities. This not only equips them to handle their roles more effectively but also shows your commitment to their career advancement.\r\n* Work-Life Balance: Encourage a healthy work-life balance by offering flexible schedules, mental health days, and ensuring that workloads are manageable.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy being generous with your team and fostering a culture of support, you can enhance employee satisfaction, which in turn, reflects in the quality of customer service and the overall success of the business. A happy and supported team is the cornerstone of any thriving retail operation. It changes the energy in the room. Your customers notice.\r\n\r\n\r\n16. Monitor Your Inventory Like A Hawk\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Critical Eye on Inventory\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the bicycle retail business, one of the most crucial aspects I managed closely was inventory aging and turnover. Understanding the pace at which different items sold, and more importantly, recognizing when they didn't, was fundamental to maintaining a healthy business. This vigilance allowed us to optimize our stock levels, ensuring that our working capital wasn't tied up in products that weren't moving. \r\n\r\n\r\nI personally oversaw the ordering of new inventory, as the cost of mistakes could be significant, particularly with bikes. It was something I could never quite muster up the courage to delegate. \r\n\r\n\r\nMy favorite metric for evaluating inventory was “gross margin per inventory dollar” - you can measure it for your whole store, by department, by brand, by SKU, etc. If we had $10,000 worth of bicycle gloves in stock and we earned $4,000 in gross margin per month selling them, then you earn $0.40 for every $1.00 invested in gloves that month. And every month we evaluated the gloves to see which are contributing and which aren’t. Which brands are selling through fastest? Short finger or long finger gloves? Men’s vs Women’s vs Kids? Insulated? \r\n\r\nFor the SKUs that are working, get more like them. For the SKUs that aren’t working, ruthlessly cut them, no matter how much you like them yourself. \r\n\r\n\r\nApplying to Cannabis Retail\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the cannabis retail sector, the same principles of inventory management apply but are accentuated by the unique characteristics of cannabis products, such as perishability and regulatory constraints. Monitoring inventory aging becomes even more critical, as the freshness of products can directly impact their efficacy and appeal. Similarly, understanding inventory turnover rates by vendor and department allows dispensaries to make informed decisions about which products to restock, introduce, or discontinue.\r\n\r\n\r\nBest Practices for Effective Inventory Management\r\n\r\n\r\n* Regular Inventory Reviews: Conduct frequent assessments of stock levels, sell-through rates, and aging to identify slow-moving items promptly.\r\n* Data-Driven Ordering: Leverage sales data and trends to guide your ordering decisions, ensuring that you're replenishing popular items and exploring new products that align with customer preferences.\r\n* Reorder Points: Use reorder points on popular products to minimize stockouts. These re-order points should always be a function of sales velocity and supplier lead time.\r\n* Clearance Strategies: Develop strategic approaches for moving aging inventory, such as clearance sales or promotions, to free up space and capital for new products.\r\n* Vendor Analysis: Evaluate the performance of products by vendor to determine which partnerships are most beneficial for your dispensary.\r\n* Employee Involvement: While the final decisions on inventory may rest with management, involving your team in the review process can provide valuable insights from the sales floor. Make sure you have a system to get feedback from your employees about products people are asking for that you don’t have (but don’t overreact to single requests).\r\n\r\n\r\nBy adopting a disciplined approach to inventory management, you can minimize waste, optimize your product offerings, and ensure that your shelves are stocked with items that meet their customers' needs and desires.\r\n\r\n\r\nParting Words\r\n\r\n\r\nI hope this journey through the lessons I learned in retail has unveiled universal truths applicable across the retail spectrum, including the cannabis industry. I hope there is a nugget somewhere in here that you can bring back to your business and make it better than it was yesterday.",

    "content": "﻿From 6.5/10 To Great\r\nThe Tragedy and Opportunity in Our Initial Average Rating\r\nImagine walking into a cannabis dispensary, hoping to find something to help you unwind after a long week or finally get a good night’s sleep. Instead, you’re met with an overwhelming wall of products with names like “Gorilla Lemon Haze” and “Purple Starship” that sound intriguing yet offer no real clues about their effects. THC percentages scream from labels, promising potency - but potency for what purpose?\r\nYou turn to the budtender, who is enthusiastic but constrained by a multitude of limitations. With recommendations like “this one’s fire,” the guidance often stops short of delivering any meaningful insight. This is the reality many cannabis consumers face today, one where noise - whether potency, price, or hype - drowns out clarity. \r\nCannabis is capable of so much more than this experience offers.\r\nThe Industry’s (and Humanity’s) Missed Opportunity\r\nThe challenge for cannabis consumers isn’t just the overwhelming number of choices. It’s the missed potential when products don’t deliver as expected. \r\nIn the Jointly app, we’ve asked hundreds of thousands of people over and over again for years: \r\n1. What’s your goal in consuming cannabis? \r\n2. On a scale of 1 to 10, how well is the cannabis product you are using helping you reach that goal?\r\nThe answer?\r\n\r\nA measly 6.5 out of 10 - across consumers of all experience levels in all 50 states.\r\n\r\nFor a plant praised for its potential, this should be disappointing to everyone who believes in what cannabis can truly do.\r\nBut why such mediocre results? \r\nThe answer is straightforward: the industry has centered around potency and price, largely overlooking the consumer’s unique journey. Too often, consumers are left to feel like they’re simply onlookers in a noisy marketplace rather than participants in a journey that could be life-enhancing. This chaotic, hit-or-miss experience results in many people walking away with products that don’t serve their real needs, sometimes leading them to question if cannabis can deliver at all.\r\nA Path Forward: Purposeful Consumption\r\nThere is a path forward. A path for getting consumers from 6.5 to 10. And it begins with that one question we keep asking: Why am I using cannabis? Purposeful cannabis consumption is an approach that reframes this question as a foundational step in a system of discovery. It moves away from guessing and toward an intentional practice where each experience can be fine-tuned to match the consumer’s specific goals. Whether the goal is relaxation, focus, sleep, or social enjoyment, purposeful consumption guides consumers to consider not only the product but also factors like timing, mindset, and even hydration.\r\nOur data-backed framework at Jointly offers a way for consumers to track and improve their cannabis experiences, logging goals, and noting which products, doses, and environments lead to their best outcomes. This framework transforms the cannabis journey from a chaotic guessing game into a puzzle that consumers can solve piece by piece. And with each small step, those elusive 10/10 experiences become increasingly common.\r\nFrom Chaos to Control\r\nTake our fictional consumer, for example. At first, their experience is full of missteps, as they try products labeled for relaxation that leave them dazed, or attempt doses that prove too strong. But through Jointly’s framework, they learn from each session, logging what works and what doesn’t. Over time, they see patterns emerge: specific products, doses, and conditions that reliably produce the desired effect. This is about building a relationship with cannabis, one built on data, wisdom, and discovery.\r\nAnd it’s through this gradual process that they find their way from a 6.5 experience to moments that feel truly exceptional, experiences that align not just with their goals but with their lives. By learning to use cannabis purposefully, they aren’t simply getting “high” - they’re enhancing their well-being, tapping into deeper creativity, relaxation, or social enjoyment.\r\nThe Power of Community\r\nPurposeful consumption isn’t just a personal journey; it’s part of a larger movement. With each experience logged, each insight shared, our community of Jointly users contributes to a growing body of knowledge that helps others discover the benefits of purposeful cannabis use. These collective insights allow consumers to move beyond a one-size-fits-all mentality and discover the specific combinations that truly work for them. These are the insights that inform Jointly’s AI.\r\nImagine if the entire industry embraced this approach. Instead of prioritizing THC percentages or discounts, dispensaries could emphasize meaningful connections between products and consumers’ needs. Budtenders would have the tools to guide customers confidently, backed by data and real-world results. The cannabis industry could finally step into its full potential - not just as an industry, but as a force for personal wellness, connection, and growth.\r\nUnlocking a 10/10 Experience, Together\r\nThe future of cannabis lies in purpose, performance, and personalization. As consumers become more empowered to practice purposeful cannabis consumption, the average experience will rise, and that elusive 10/10 will no longer seem like a myth. Instead, it will become the expectation.\r\nWhat would this mean for our struggling industry?\r\nCannabis, when consumed purposefully, makes you more - not less. With each goal set, each reflection logged, Jointly and its community are building a brighter, clearer future for cannabis, where every purchase isn’t just a transaction but a step toward a better life.",

    "content": "﻿What Can AI Do For Cannabis Consumers?\r\nArtificial Intelligence has come a long way, evolving from the clunky, rudimentary computing of the mid-twentieth century into the large language models (LLMs) of today that can almost feel human in their capabilities. AI has now become a force capable of learning, predicting, and personalizing at an astonishing scale.\r\nThink about it: AI curates your playlists, plans your commutes, decides which news you see next, and even helps doctors diagnose illnesses. It’s already woven into our daily lives, yet we’re still just beginning to grasp its impact and its potential. The AI revolution isn’t some distant, sudden event - it’s unfolding right now, quietly embedding itself into every aspect of human endeavor.\r\nFor cannabis consumers, it’s my view that this technological evolution represents an especially exciting opportunity. AI has the potential to transform how we learn about, shop for, and enjoy our cannabis experiences.\r\nAI Isn’t Just Another Tool\r\nLet’s pause for a moment and address a deeper truth about AI. Predicting the future of AI is, frankly, a dangerous business right now. No one truly knows where this is all headed, and anyone who claims to have all the answers is kidding themselves. There will likely be parts of this post that I read later and cringe. What I do believe we know is that AI is not just another feature, program, or technological trend - it’s a fundamental change in the fabric of society itself.\r\nAI is as consequential as fire, electricity, language, or the internet. Just as those breakthroughs rewired the way we live, work, and think, AI will reshape nearly every corner of existence. There will not be a single facet of life untouched by this shift. “How are you using AI in your life or business?” will soon sound as strange as asking, “How are you using electricity in your life?” or “How are you using the internet at work?”\r\nFor cannabis consumers and the industry (and humanity) as a whole, the implications are profound. The question isn’t whether AI will play a role in cannabis - it’s how deeply it will integrate into the entire consumer ecosystem, from education to retail to personal wellness.\r\nData as the Foundation\r\nAt its core, AI runs on data. It learns by analyzing vast amounts of information, spotting patterns, and using those patterns to make predictions or decisions. Here’s the most important thing: AI is only as good as the data it’s trained on. Feed it biased, incomplete, or outdated data, and you’ll get skewed or unreliable results.\r\nFor cannabis consumers, this is a critical point. The value of an AI system lies in the richness and accuracy of its data. When trained on comprehensive, high-quality information about products, consumption methods, and individual outcomes, AI can turn a confusing world of options into a clear, personalized roadmap.\r\nImagine a future where choosing the right strain, dose, or product isn’t a frustrating process of trial and error but a confident, informed decision guided by insights from thousands of experiences like yours. That’s the promise of AI: helping you make smarter, more effective choices while avoiding the frustrations of guesswork.\r\nAI for Education and Learning\r\nOne of the biggest barriers for cannabis consumers today is understanding the plant itself. What are cannabinoids and terpenes? How does smoking compare to edibles or tinctures? Why does one strain relax you while another gives you energy?\r\nIn the past, finding these answers required hours of research, trial and error, or relying on often-conflicting advice. AI changes that. It acts like a personal tutor, translating the science of cannabis into clear, actionable insights. Trained on reliable data, it can guide you through the nuances of consumption: which cannabinoids and terpenes support specific goals, how dosing works, and why factors like hydration, sleep, and even your setting can impact your experience.\r\nThis isn’t just about making cannabis easier to use - it’s about empowering you to take control of your experience. Cannabis is a complex plant, and AI helps simplify that complexity into something you can understand, use, and even master.\r\nAI for Personalized Recommendations\r\nCannabis is one of the most personal products you’ll ever interact with. Its effects can vary wildly depending on your unique biology, your consumption method, and the product itself. What works wonders for one person might do the opposite for someone else.\r\nThis complexity is where AI shines. By analyzing your preferences, goals, and past experiences, AI can provide deeply personalized recommendations. It doesn’t just look at surface-level factors like strain type or brand promises, it dives into cannabinoid content, terpene profiles, flavor and aroma preferences, and real-world data from people with similar goals.\r\nAI can adapt its guidance to your evolving needs. Over time, it can become a trusted partner, learning alongside you as you navigate your cannabis journey.\r\nShopping Made Smarter\r\nFor many people, shopping for cannabis can feel overwhelming. Dirty parking lots, uninviting storefronts, high security, rows of strangely named products, cryptic labels, and technical jargon can make even seasoned users feel like beginners. AI transforms this process into an empowering experience.\r\nAn AI-driven shopping assistant can guide you through the maze, offering clear explanations and personalized suggestions. Never judging. It’s not just about telling you what to buy - it’s about helping you understand why certain products are a better fit for your goals and what you can do to have the best possible experience..\r\nFurther Reading / Learning\r\nThere’s no shortage of resources claiming to teach you about AI, but most of them are noise - people chasing clicks and pretending to be experts. To cut through the clutter, here are two resources I highly recommend:\r\n1. Ethan Mollick’s Co-Intelligence: Living and Working With AI\r\nMollick has written one of the best books on the topic, period. If you want to stay ahead of the curve, this is essential reading. His blog, One Useful Thing, is also a treasure trove of insights that will put you miles ahead of your peers when it comes to understanding where AI is headed.\r\n2. Benedict Evans’ AI Eats The World\r\nThis recent presentation does an excellent job of framing the right questions to ask about AI today. It’s not just about understanding what AI can do - it’s about grasping the profound implications it has for society, work, and life as we know it.\r\nJointly’s Role in AI for Cannabis Consumers\r\nAt Jointly, we’re dedicated to helping consumers navigate cannabis with clarity, confidence, and purpose. Our AI tools are powered by the largest consumer-driven cannabis data set in the world, allowing us to connect your goals with the products, brands, and methods most likely to deliver the results you want.\r\nBut Jointly isn’t just about product recommendations - it’s about education, empowerment, and evolution. Jointly’s platform helps you understand how to optimize your experiences over time, considering factors like dosage, timing, and lifestyle elements such as hydration and sleep. Every interaction makes the system smarter, ensuring that our guidance gets better and better as you reflect on your outcomes.\r\nWe believe that cannabis is a deeply personal journey, and our mission is to help you navigate it with intention. With the power of AI and data, we’re creating a future where cannabis consumers can make informed, purposeful choices every step of the way.\r\n\r\n—--\r\nNote: Always a good Bayesian, I look forward to (and reserve the right to) update my opinions and positions when presented with new information.",

    "content": "﻿What Does AI Mean For Cannabis Retailers / Dispensaries?\r\nRunning a dispensary means navigating complexity every day. You’re managing inventory, training budtenders, building customer loyalty, and keeping up with regulations - all while trying to stand out in a crowded market. \r\n\r\nAnd now, there’s a new buzzword (buzzabbreviation?) floating around: AI.\r\nYou’ve probably heard that artificial intelligence is changing the game for retailers, promising everything from smarter inventory management to personalized customer experiences. But what does that really mean for your dispensary? And, more importantly, how can you separate the useful tools from the overhyped distractions?\r\nThis piece is here to help. We’ll explore what AI actually is, how it’s already reshaping industries, and the ways it could solve some of the challenges dispensaries face. Along the way, we’ll share how to evaluate AI solutions so you can make smart decisions for your business.\r\nBecause here’s the thing: AI is moving fast - faster than most of us can fully process. It’s a risky time to make big predictions about where this technology will take us. But one thing is clear: AI has the potential to transform the fabric of society, and cannabis retail will be no exception.\r\nWhat Is AI and Why Does It Matter?\r\nArtificial intelligence gets thrown around a lot these days, but what does it actually mean? At its core, AI is a way to teach machines to learn, adapt, and make decisions. Instead of being programmed step by step, like old-school software, AI systems are trained on data to recognize patterns and solve problems.\r\nAI has been evolving for decades. It started with simple programs that could play chess or solve math problems, but now it powers tools we use every day - like recommending movies on Netflix, suggesting products on Amazon, or even driving cars. And here’s what makes AI different from past technologies: it doesn’t just speed things up or automate tasks. It can fundamentally change how things are done by predicting outcomes, personalizing experiences, and continuously improving itself as it learns.\r\nIn retail, AI has already reshaped industries. Big-box stores use it to predict what inventory to stock and when. Streaming services use it to keep viewers hooked.[a] And in cannabis, where products and consumer needs are so varied, AI is poised to help dispensaries connect the right customer with the right product in ways that feel personal and precise.\r\nAI matters because it’s not just another tool - it’s an amplifier. When applied thoughtfully, it can help you make better decisions faster, serve your customers more effectively, and ultimately, grow your business. The key, though, is understanding what problems you want to solve before diving into this technology.\r\nA Word of Caution About AI\r\nLet’s pause for a reality check: AI isn’t a magic wand, and it’s not going to solve every problem in your business. Just because AI can do something doesn’t mean it’s solving an important issue for you. The most successful dispensaries focus on one question: “What are the biggest problems holding us back?” Then they look for tools - AI or otherwise - that solve those problems.\r\nAnother thing to watch out for is the hype. AI is one of those buzzwords that gets slapped on everything, even when it doesn’t belong. Some companies will use \"AI\" as a marketing gimmick, but what they’re offering might just be basic automation or data analysis with a fancy label. That’s why it’s critical to know how to ask the right questions when evaluating AI solutions:\r\n* Where does the data come from? (Is it reliable, and does it reflect the kind of consumers you serve?)\r\n* How does the AI work? (Is it learning from real-world results or just making guesses based on chemistry or broad trends?)\r\n* How are decisions and recommendations validated? (Can the company prove their system works with real, measurable outcomes?)\r\nAI can absolutely be transformative, but only if it’s solving the right problems in the right ways. By staying focused on what matters to your business and asking smart questions, you can avoid the hype and make decisions that actually move the needle.\r\nThe Dispensary of the Present\r\nRunning a dispensary today is a juggling act. You’re balancing compliance with ever-changing regulations, educating customers who range from first-timers to seasoned experts, and managing staff turnover - all while trying to keep your shelves stocked with the right products.\r\nThen there’s the customer experience. When a consumer walks into your store, they’re often overwhelmed by the sheer number of choices. THC percentages and price tend to dominate the conversation, but we know that doesn’t tell the whole story of what makes a product right for someone. For budtenders, this means shouldering a lot of the responsibility for guiding customers, often relying on personal experience and intuition.\r\nOn top of that, the cannabis industry is evolving at breakneck speed. The pressure to stay ahead - whether that’s with new product offerings, better marketing, or improved customer retention strategies - feels relentless.\r\nFor all its challenges, though, this industry is still driven by something remarkable: the power of the plant and the connection it creates between people and the moments of discovery in creates within ourselves. The question now is, how can technology, including AI, help make the hard parts of running a dispensary easier so you can focus on the things that matter most?[b]\r\nAI Use Cases for Dispensaries\r\nSo, how can AI help dispensaries solve the real challenges they face? The potential goes beyond customer interactions - it spans nearly every aspect of running a successful operation. AI isn’t just another tool; it can be a powerful assistant for everyone in your business, from budtenders to store managers to the leadership team. Here’s how:\r\nAI as a Work Assistant:\r\nAI can help everyone on your team become better at what they do. It’s not just about using AI to draft an email or summarize data; it’s about using it to think through problems, learn new skills, and make better decisions. Whether it’s generating ideas for a new marketing campaign, analyzing customer data to identify trends, or even helping a manager prepare a training session, AI is there to amplify human effort. The key is encouraging your team to experiment with AI tools and learn how to apply them in their specific roles.\r\nFor anyone who wants to dive deeper into how AI can transform the way we live and work, I highly recommend Ethan Mollick’s Co-Intelligence: Living and Working with AI. It’s an accessible guide to understanding how to collaborate with AI, no matter your industry or expertise level.\r\n\r\nRead that before you consider how to employ AI in your business.[c]\r\nSpecific Applications in the Dispensary:\r\nCustomer Experience:\r\nAI can personalize how you serve customers. Tools like virtual budtenders offer 24/7 support online or in-store, guiding customers to the right products based on their goals - whether it’s relaxation, better sleep, or focus. These systems use real-world data to make tailored recommendations, building trust and satisfaction​​.\r\nInventory Management:\r\nStocking cannabis is a balancing act. AI tools can analyze sales patterns and predict future demand, helping you optimize inventory so you’re never over- or understocked​.\r\nMarketing and Loyalty:\r\nAI can segment customers based on their behaviors, enabling personalized promotions and tailored educational content. By identifying what drives repeat visits, you can design loyalty programs that resonate​.\r\nEmployee Training and Retention:\r\nBudtender turnover is a common challenge, but AI can simplify onboarding and professional development. AI tools can train budtenders using data-backed insights, empowering them to confidently guide customers to the best choices​.\r\nCompliance and Reporting:\r\nStaying compliant can be a headache. AI can automate much of the reporting process, keeping records accurate and up to date while reducing manual workload.\r\nJointly's Role in This Space:\r\nAt Jointly, we offer AI-powered tools focused on customer experience and professional development for budtenders. While these solutions address critical aspects of dispensary operations, the goal of this piece isn’t to sell you on them. Instead, it’s to show you how AI can enhance every level of your business when applied thoughtfully.\r\nAI isn’t just about solving problems - it’s about creating opportunities. By encouraging your team to experiment with AI and embrace it as a collaborator, you can elevate your dispensary’s operations, empower your staff, and provide exceptional service to your customers.\r\nHow AI Can Drive Business Results\r\nAI isn’t just a shiny new tool - it’s a way to measurably improve your business. When applied thoughtfully, it can drive real results across the board, from sales to customer loyalty to operational efficiency. Here’s how:\r\n1. Boosting Sales and Average Cart Size\r\nAI-powered recommendations can help customers find products tailored to their needs, whether they’re looking for pain relief, creativity, or relaxation. When customers feel confident about their choices, they’re more likely to buy - and to buy more. Many dispensaries using AI tools report higher average ticket sizes, thanks to upselling and cross-selling opportunities informed by data.\r\n2. Increasing Customer Satisfaction and Loyalty\r\nWhen AI connects the right customer with the right product, the results speak for themselves: happier customers who are more likely to return. By personalizing the shopping experience, AI builds trust and strengthens the relationship between your dispensary and your customers​​.\r\n3. Reducing Costs and Improving Efficiency\r\nAutomation is a key strength of AI. Whether it’s optimizing inventory, streamlining compliance reporting, or assisting with employee training, AI reduces the manual workload on your team. This not only saves time and money but also frees up your staff to focus on higher-value tasks.\r\n4. Supporting Strategic Decision-Making\r\nAI doesn’t just handle routine tasks - it can also provide insights that help you make smarter decisions. For example, analyzing sales data to identify emerging trends or flagging products that aren’t moving. When you have a clearer picture of what’s working and what isn’t, you can adapt faster to changes in the market.\r\nAI’s greatest strength isn’t just in how it improves individual areas of your business, but in how it ties everything together. From improving the customer experience to streamlining operations, AI creates a more seamless, efficient, and profitable operation overall.[d]\r\nEthical and Practical Considerations\r\nAs powerful as AI can be, it’s not without its challenges. Dispensaries adopting AI need to think carefully about how it’s implemented and the potential pitfalls to avoid. Here are some key considerations:\r\n1. Transparency and Trust\r\nAI’s value comes from its ability to make recommendations and decisions, but these need to be clear and trustworthy. Consumers should know why a particular product is recommended to them. Is it based on real-world data? On their personal preferences? Ensuring transparency builds trust with your customers and keeps them coming back.\r\n2. Data Privacy\r\nCannabis is still a stigmatized industry for many, and customers may feel sensitive about how their data is used. Be upfront about what information you collect, how it’s stored, and how it’s protected. Using AI responsibly means prioritizing data privacy and reassuring customers that their information is safe.\r\n3. Balancing AI and Human Expertise\r\nAI should enhance, not replace, the human touch. Budtenders remain a critical part of the customer experience, providing empathy, personal anecdotes, and insights that AI can’t replicate. The most effective dispensaries will pair AI’s precision with the warmth and creativity of human staff.[e]\r\n4. Staying Critical of the Technology\r\nAI is only as good as the data and algorithms behind it. As a dispensary owner or manager, it’s essential to evaluate the AI tools you’re considering carefully:\r\n* What biases could be present in the data?\r\n* How is the AI trained, and how often is it updated?\r\n* Can the company prove the results their technology claims to deliver?\r\n5. Ethical Selling Practices\r\nAI can make upselling easier, but dispensaries have a responsibility to ensure that recommendations are in the customer’s best interest. Building a loyal customer base means prioritizing their needs over short-term sales.\r\nBy approaching AI thoughtfully, dispensaries can leverage its power to improve operations and customer satisfaction while avoiding missteps that could harm their reputation. It’s not about blindly adopting every new tool; it’s about making decisions that align with your values and long-term goals.\r\nA Call to Action\r\nIf you’re feeling inspired - or maybe a little overwhelmed - by the possibilities AI offers, that’s a good place to start. The next step is to figure out how this technology fits into your dispensary. Here’s a simple roadmap to help you take action:\r\n1. Start with Your Biggest Challenges\r\nWhat’s the single most frustrating problem in your business right now? Is it inventory that’s always out of sync? Training new budtenders? Helping customers find the right product in less time? Let that challenge guide your exploration of AI tools. Focus on solutions that address real pain points.\r\n2. Experiment and Learn\r\nAI doesn’t require an all-or-nothing approach. Start small - maybe by testing an AI-powered virtual budtender on your website or using AI to optimize your inventory management. See how it performs, collect feedback, and adjust.\r\n3. Invest in AI Literacy for Your Team\r\nAI works best when everyone knows how to use it. Encourage your team to get comfortable with the technology, whether that’s learning to ask better questions of an AI tool or using it to tackle creative tasks. Empowering your employees to see AI as a partner can unlock new opportunities for your business.\r\n4. Don’t Go It Alone\r\nTalk to other dispensary owners, ask vendors tough questions, and lean on trusted partners in the industry. Collaboration can help you uncover best practices and avoid common pitfalls.\r\n5. Keep Your Eyes on the Future\r\nAI is evolving rapidly. Stay curious, keep experimenting, and be open to new possibilities. Whether it’s marketing, customer experience, or compliance, the tools available today are just the beginning of what’s possible.\r\nAs you explore AI, remember that it’s not about chasing every shiny new thing. It’s about building a better dispensary, step by step. Take your time, ask the right questions, and invest in tools that make a real difference for your business and your customers.\r\nConclusion\r\nIt’s an exciting - and unpredictable - time to be talking about AI. The technology is evolving at a pace that’s hard to fully grasp, and while it’s tempting to make bold predictions, the truth is we don’t know exactly where this journey will take us. What we do know is that AI has the potential to transform the way dispensaries operate, from streamlining day-to-day tasks to creating deeply personalized customer experiences.\r\nFor dispensary owners and managers, the key is to approach AI thoughtfully. Focus on solving the problems that matter most to your business. Look beyond the hype and ask tough questions about how an AI tool works, where the data comes from, and what real value it can deliver.\r\nChange doesn’t happen overnight, and progress is rarely linear. But by staying curious and open to experimentation, you can position your dispensary to thrive in an industry that’s constantly evolving. AI is a powerful ally, but ultimately, it’s still a tool - a means to amplify your team’s efforts, improve your customers’ lives, and grow your business.\r\nThe future of AI in cannabis is unwritten, and that’s what makes it so exciting. As you navigate this new landscape, remember that the best solutions are the ones that help you build something enduring. Step into this new era thoughtfully, and you’ll be ready to harness the full potential of what AI has to offer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[a]Maybe have examples (with actual companies) that go more in depth to help people really understand how much they already interact with AI in their everyday lives. It could help make it more relatable.\r\n[b]This is, perhaps, the most important line of the essay so far.\r\n[c]Wait, no, don't. Just read Dave's work and then buy yourself a Virtual Budtender. Don't make them go read even more!\r\n[d]Powerful\r\n[e]Very powerful. AI should be to streamline and improve, not replace.",

As the stigma fades, I believe the language we use to describe our experiences with cannabis needs to evolve, too. \r\n\r\nThe term “high” has long been saddled with negative connotations, remnants of decades of prohibition, misinformation, and misunderstanding. For this reason, I hardly mention the word “high” in the Theory of Purposeful Cannabis Consumption. \r\n\r\n\r\nBut what if we could reframe this? What if being “high” wasn’t a blanket term but a nuanced state of being, as varied and personal as the individuals experiencing it? This is where the concept of being “pie high” comes into play.\r\n\r\n\r\nFirst, some background: The data underpinning what it means to be “pie high” comes from an analysis of 396,753 unique cannabis experiences recorded in the Jointly app since 2020. Using the app, individuals:\r\n1. record their goals for cannabis consumption\r\n2. select their products from a database of legal products including their characteristics\r\n3. rate their experiences on a scale of 1 to 10\r\n4. track various factors impacting their results.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis wealth of data offers us unprecedented insights into the multifaceted nature of cannabis consumption.\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore we get into the pie, let’s talk more about the word “high.” It’s a term that, for many, conjures images far removed from the reality of modern, purposeful cannabis use. The stigma attached to this word is a legacy of a bygone era, one that I am eager to leave behind. \r\n\r\n\r\nI see us at a crossroads: Do we abandon “high” for new terminology? Or do we reclaim it, infusing it with the positivity and the truth our data supports? \r\n\r\n\r\nI propose that we choose the latter, focusing on the goals of consumption and the experiences sought, rather than the singular state of being “high.” It’s an injustice to view “high” as a singular state - the experience is deeply personal and varied, influenced by a myriad of factors.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis brings us to the “pie” chart that is the inspiration for this post and this addition to our cannabis lexicon - the chart is a visual representation of the ideal cannabis experience, or being “Pie High.” This pie chart, adding up to a perfect 10/10 experience, is divided into slices representing factors that can enhance or detract from one’s cannabis journey. The percentages represent, across 396,753 unique cannabis experiences, the relative impact of that factor on the overall experience.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSee how the data show that, if you get your product and dose exactly right, but you muck up the rest, the best you can do is a a 6/10 experience (on average). \r\n\r\nIf you get the product or the dose wrong? Forget about it.\r\n\r\n\r\nLook at how much isn’t about the product.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo achieve that 10/10, or “Pie High,” individuals must fine-tune each component to their unique preferences and goals. This is the essence of purposeful consumption, and it’s what the Jointly app facilitates.\r\n\r\nHere’s a breakdown in non-pie form:\r\n\r\n\r\nSpecific Product\r\n\t26%\r\n\tDose\r\n\t25%\r\n\tProduct Type\r\n\t8%\r\n\tProduct Factors\r\n\t59%\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\tSetting\r\n\t7%\r\n\tConsuming with whom\r\n\t5%\r\n\tTime of day\r\n\t4%\r\n\tDevice\r\n\t3%\r\n\tConsumption Factors\r\n\t19%\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\tSleep\r\n\t5%\r\n\tHydration\r\n\t5%\r\n\tStomach fullness\r\n\t5%\r\n\tExercise\r\n\t4%\r\n\tTime since last consumption\r\n\t4%\r\n\tPhysical Factors\r\n\t23%\r\n\t\r\n\r\nFor consumers, this means taking control of your cannabis experience. It’s about being mindful of not just what you consume, but how, when, and in what context. It’s about crafting the conditions that lead to your ideal “Pie High” - whether that’s deep relaxation, creative stimulation, or anything in between.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt's worth noting that the influence of each slice is not universal - it varies across individuals, genders, and age groups. The figures provided offer a general guideline, derived from a broad spectrum of consumers.\r\n\r\n\r\nDelving deeper into the \"Specific Product\" slice lies the nuanced role of cannabinoids and terpenes in shaping your ultimate experience. This intricate dance of compounds is the backbone of Jointly's product recommendations. These aren't merely our recommendations but a collective wisdom distilled from countless individual experiences.\r\n\r\n\r\nConsider this: Prior to embracing purposeful consumption, the average cannabis experience, as rated by consumers before using the Jointly app, hovers around 6.5 out of 10. Reflecting on your own experiences, where would they rank on this scale? Legal cannabis is expensive. Today only happens once. Go for a 10.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor retailers, brands, and sellers, this perspective is equally transformative. Even the finest cannabis products contribute to only a portion of the consumer’s experience. The rest is shaped by factors outside your control. However, you have a choice: Leave it to chance, or actively educate and guide your customers towards their perfect “Pie High,” using tools like Jointly’s Spark Pro and the wisdom about product performance in the data we’ve gathered.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow much more would your products be appreciated? How much more would people buy? How much more joy would be out there if people were at a 10 instead of a 6.5? How many people have a 5 experience and never come back?\r\n\r\n\r\nHow was the pie calculated? Basic statistics / data science, analyzing the variance in experiences across different conditions and normalizing these to present a comprehensive picture of what influences the cannabis experience. This approach recognizes that while some factors, like hydration, have a universally positive correlation with experience quality, others are deeply personal and can vary in either direction.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe term “pie high” might be new, but its concept is timeless. It’s about finding your perfect balance, your ideal state where cannabis enhances your life in exactly the way you desire. It’s a reminder that the cannabis experience is as diverse as the people who partake in it, and that there’s a “pie” for every occasion, for every individual.\r\n\r\n\r\nPersonally, I have a pie for writing, a pie for hiking, a pie for watching Love Island with Ivanna, and a pie for going out to eat.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf people embraced the concept of being “pie high,” we wouldn’t just be redefining a word - we’d be reshaping the narrative around cannabis - moving towards a future where cannabis consumption is understood, respected, and tailored to the individual, supported by data and driven by purpose. \r\n\r\n\r\nWelcome to the era of the “pie high” – may you find your perfect pie.\r\n\r\nPS And, by the way, after we’ve sufficiently reclaimed the word “high” when it comes to cannabis, we can drop the “pie” part. That’s silly.\r\n\r\n\r\nPPS What about mindset?\r\n\r\nIn the landscape of cannabis experiences, the \"Pie High\" model maps out the terrain, guiding users towards their optimum state. However, one might wonder why mindset—a factor often touted in discussions around psychedelic and cannabis experiences—is absent from the pie. The omission of pre-cannabis session mindset from the model is a deliberate choice, grounded in the pursuit of clarity and measurability.\r\n\r\n\r\nMindset, while undeniably influential, is a nebulous concept, inherently subjective and deeply personal. It's shaped by an intricate web of psychological, emotional, and situational factors, making it challenging to quantify or standardize. In contrast, the components included in the \"Pie High\" model—such as specific product, dose, and setting—are tangible and directly actionable. They offer clear pathways for experimentation and adjustment, allowing users to systematically tailor their cannabis experiences.\r\n\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the \"Pie High\" model emphasizes factors that users can consciously manipulate before and during their cannabis sessions. While mindset is certainly a part of the preparatory phase, its fluid and dynamic nature defies simple categorization or modification through an app interface. Instead, by focusing on quantifiable and controllable elements, the model empowers users to construct their ideal cannabis experience from a foundation of concrete, actionable steps.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis approach aligns with the ethos of purposeful consumption championed by Jointly. It underscores the idea that achieving the perfect \"Pie High\" is not solely about internal readiness but about actively shaping the external conditions that contribute to the cannabis experience. In doing so, the model respects the complexity of mindset without letting it cloud the clarity of the path to an ideal cannabis state.",

    "content": "﻿Cannabis Shopping, Simplified\r\nThe Power of Goals and Data in Navigating Cannabis Choices\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the modern legal cannabis market, consumers face a bewildering array of products promising a variety of effects. It’s a great time to be a cannabis consumer. Yet, without robust data to guide their choices, many are left relying on anecdotal advice and marketing hype. \r\n\r\n\r\nI co-founded Jointly to help people discover better wellbeing with cannabis. I feel strongly that the current methods of selecting which cannabis to buy and which cannabis to sell—based on potency, price, strain names, and other superficial factors—are inadequate and often misleading. \r\n\r\n\r\nI will offer as a solution Jointly’s goal-based framework, grounded in extensive consumer data. It offers a revolutionary approach to cannabis shopping and selling. By focusing on what truly matters—utilizing cannabis to reach specific goal states that enable joy and relief and discovery—we can enhance consumer satisfaction and ensure more reliable, effective use of cannabis products.\r\n\r\n\r\nImagine going into a pharmacy like Walgreens or CVS where the pharmacist isn't prescribing your medicine based on evidence that it works for the reason you need it, as evaluated by a third party like the FDA. Instead, picture a pharmacy where the pharmacist recommends products based on personal experience or the last pitch they heard from a brand rep. Extend this analogy to the modern cannabis dispensary, where budtenders are expected to provide effective product recommendations without data to support their claims. \r\n\r\nI’ve spent a lot of time in retail over the years and that gives me a tremendous respect for role of the budtender in the modern dispensary. They’re asked to do an impossible job and are often vastly underpaid, undertrained, and undersupported. Most are doing their best, but it's unfair to expect them to make reliable recommendations without data. \r\n\r\nThe influence of budtender recommendations on cannabis customers' purchasing decisions varies by market, but studies and surveys consistently show that a significant percentage of customers rely on these recommendations. According to various industry reports, approximately 40-60% of cannabis customers choose their products based on recommendations from their budtender. \r\n\r\n\r\nIs it unethical of the cannabis industry to ask budtenders to sell products by the effects they provide without actual data on the effectiveness of those products in providing those effects? If not unethical - irresponsible, at least? \r\n\r\nAs the wave of cannabis legalization continues, acceptance is growing, and the stigma is dying. Across the country, legal dispensaries are opening. It’s a new era of cannabis consumption. However, these dispensaries are filled with complex products that produce a variety of effects, and people shop for and consume cannabis for at least 12 different reasons. \r\n\r\n\r\nMy point of view (and a large part of the reason for Jointly’s existence) is that cannabis retailers and their employees are making product recommendations without the data they need. Likewise, cannabis consumers are buying products without the data they need. Most are doing their best to learn from the information available to them, and there are some great training and certification programs for budtenders. Still, in my view, it is inappropriate to make product recommendations for a substance that acts like a complex pharmaceutical without supporting data. \r\n\r\n\r\nExisting frameworks for product selection contradict, compete, and confuse. We can do better. \r\n\r\n\r\nLet's examine some of the most common methods people use to choose their next cannabis product and discuss their benefits and pitfalls.\r\n\r\n\r\nPotency\r\n\r\n\r\nThe belief that higher potency equates to a better experience is a pervasive and dangerous myth in the cannabis industry. While it’s true that THC levels can influence the intensity of the effects, they don’t necessarily correlate with a better or more enjoyable experience. Higher potency products can often lead to undesirable side effects like anxiety or paranoia, especially for novice users. The pursuit of potency overlooks the nuanced interplay of cannabinoids and terpenes that create the full spectrum of cannabis effects. Instead, a data-driven approach that considers user goals and product performance can offer more tailored and satisfying experiences.\r\n\r\n\r\nPrice & Discounts\r\n\r\n\r\nPrice is a significant factor for consumers, especially with inflation driving up the cost of many staples. It’s important to spend money wisely on cannabis, but lower prices and discounts can often lead to suboptimal purchases. How much money is wasted on the wrong product just because it’s on sale? Discounted products might not meet the specific needs of the consumer, leading to bad or suboptimal experiences. The goal should be to find the right products for the right purposes, which can save money in the long run by avoiding these mistakes.\r\n\r\n\r\nStrains\r\n\r\n\r\nRelying on strain names to determine the effects of cannabis products is an outdated practice. As discussed in the article “Why Jointly is Better Than a Strain Finder”, strain names are not a reliable indicator of the effects a consumer can expect. The same strain name can produce different effects depending on the grower, the specific genetic makeup, the cultivation methods used, and the season. This variability makes it difficult for consumers to make informed decisions based solely on strain names.\r\n\r\n\r\nStrain Types: Indica, Sativa, Hybrid\r\n\r\n\r\nThe traditional classifications of indica, sativa, and hybrid are largely unhelpful for consumers seeking specific effects. The simplicity of the framework is attractive. But these terms are too broad and fail to account for the complexities of cannabis chemistry. Indica, sativa, and hybrid classifications don’t reliably predict the effects a consumer will experience. What’s more important is understanding the cannabinoid and terpene profile of a product and how these compounds interact with an individual's endocannabinoid system.\r\n\r\n\r\nBranding and Packaging\r\n\r\n\r\nChoosing a product based on branding and packaging is obviously not the best method. While attractive branding and packaging can catch a consumer’s eye, they don’t necessarily correlate with product quality. A bigger spend on branding and packaging doesn’t guarantee a better experience. The effectiveness of a product should be evaluated based on data, not marketing.\r\n\r\n\r\nCelebrity Endorsements\r\n\r\n\r\nCelebrity endorsements are an especially silly reason to choose a cannabis product. While it might be entertaining to see your favorite celebrity promoting a product, this doesn’t provide any insight into whether the product will meet your specific needs. It’s essential to base product choices on objective data rather than the influence of celebrity culture. Celebrities can help widen acceptance of cannabis and educate, but I wouldn’t listen to them about what to put in your body next.\r\n\r\n\r\nPersonal Experience of a Single Individual\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile personal testimonials can be helpful, they are limited in scope. One person’s experience with a product does not guarantee the same results for another due to the differences in individual endocannabinoid systems and personal preferences. It’s more effective to rely on a broad dataset that reflects the experiences of many people with similar goals.\r\n\r\n\r\nOnline Product Reviews\r\n\r\n\r\nOnline reviews on platforms like Leafly and Weedmaps can provide some insights, but their ratings and reviews are not goal-specific. These reviews and ratings often reflect subjective experiences that may not align with the specific goals of other consumers. For more actionable insights, reviews need to be tied to specific consumer goals and supported by comprehensive data.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpert Product Reviews\r\n\r\n\r\nExpert reviews can be enjoyable to read and may offer some valuable insights, but they often rely on the reviewer’s personal experience rather than broad data. Without a goal-specific framework, these reviews are limited in their usefulness. What works for one expert may not work for the next consumer. \r\n\r\n\r\nCannabinoids\r\n\r\n\r\nCannabis is not one uniform entity. It is a complex plant made of over 400 different phytochemicals (def: bioactive nutrient plant chemicals). Around 60 of these chemicals are cannabinoid compounds, some with opposing effects. Cannabinoids are crucial to understanding product performance. However, it’s important to work from a vast and unbiased dataset to understand how different cannabinoids contribute to achieving specific goals. Jointly’s goal-specific framework leverages extensive data to identify which cannabinoid profiles are most effective for different purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\nTerpenes\r\n\r\n\r\nTerpenes add an additional layer to the cannabis experience, much like a lavender candle enhances the ambiance of a massage. However, their impact is often overstated. The primary driver of the cannabis experience is the cannabinoids, while terpenes play a supporting role. It’s better to have a product that performs well in its primary function. And of course it’s even better to bring the whole band together for a masterful performance. And also, the names of terpenes: limonene, caryophyllene, humulene, etc. - does anybody think the modern consumer has that long of an attention span? We’re going to teach them all about terpenes and then they’ll be great consumers? That direction doesn’t feel quite right to me.To me, cannabis is about the experience that the sum of the cannabinoids and terpenes (and other phytochemicals) conspire to produce.\r\n\r\n\r\nEffects\r\n\r\n\r\nEffects are the closest proxy to goals found in the cannabis industry. However, it’s not just about experiencing certain effects like giggling or euphoria; it’s about achieving specific goal states such as pain relief, improved sleep, or relaxation. They are related. The effects help you reach the goal state. They can also take you beyond it. Understanding how different products help achieve these goal states is crucial for meaningful recommendations. And remember: One man’s effect is another man’s goal. And my goal might be your side effect. Some people want energy and some want to sleep. Some want to isolate while others want to socialize. Some want to stimulate appetite while others want to suppress it. Some want to focus and some want to forget.\r\n\r\n\r\nFlavor / Aroma\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile flavor and aroma contribute to the enjoyment of cannabis, they are secondary to the product’s performance in achieving desired effects. Consumers benefit by prioritizing effectiveness over sensory attributes, though of course both are important for a holistic experience.\r\n\r\n\r\nHouse Brands and Profit Margins\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother common but potentially harmful approach to buying or selling cannabis is focusing on house brands or products with better profit margins. Many dispensaries promote their own house brands, which are often marketed as high-quality and cost-effective. Similarly, budtenders may be incentivized to push certain products that yield higher profit margins for the store. While these practices might benefit the retailer's bottom line, they don’t necessarily serve the best interests of the consumer.\r\n\r\n\r\nHouse brands can vary widely in quality and consistency. Without robust data to support the effectiveness of these products for specific consumer goals, there’s no guarantee they will meet the needs of the buyer. Relying solely on the store’s assurances can lead to suboptimal experiences, as the focus is often more on profit than on consumer satisfaction.\r\n\r\n\r\nSimilarly, when budtenders are encouraged to sell products with higher profit margins, the recommendations may be skewed. This creates a conflict of interest where the primary goal shifts from helping the consumer find the best product to maximizing store revenue and income. This practice can erode trust between consumers and retailers, as recommendations are no longer based on what’s best for the consumer but on what’s best for the business.\r\n\r\n\r\nJointly’s Goals: Reducing Complexity, Increasing Certainty, Causing Better Outcomes\r\n\r\n\r\nJointly’s goals framework is designed to reduce complexity and increase certainty, leading to better outcomes for consumers and retailers. Using good data, people make better decisions. Jointly enables consumers to choose products based on what works best for others with the same goals. \r\n\r\n\r\nJointly’s goals are determined through a meticulous process, as explained in the article “The Goals for Your Cannabis Consumption”. This article details how we’ve identified and defined the 12 primary reasons why people consume cannabis, ranging from pain relief to enhancing creativity. \r\n\r\n\r\nIn our mobile app, we’ve asked people over and over again for 4 years, “What is your goal in consuming cannabis?” The process begins with users logging their consumption experiences and noting how well a product helped them achieve their specific goals. This process has been repeated over hundreds of thousands of unique experiences across all states and demographics. Over time, this data has accumulated in statistically meaningful ways, revealing not only the names of those goals, but also which products and product characteristics are most likely to be effective for each goal. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe goals are comprehensive. When consumers are asked “Why do you consume cannabis?” and presented with our 12 goals and a choice for “Other” - people choose 2.4 goals on average and only 2% choose “other.”\r\n\r\n\r\nOur algorithm then strips away biases and misinformation, revealing which products and combinations of cannabinoids and terpenes are most likely to produce the desired experience. The algorithm recommends products based on that vast dataset, ensuring that recommendations are unbiased and driven by real consumer experiences, as detailed in the article “Jointly Product Matching.” This piece explains how Jointly’s algorithm evaluates various factors, including cannabinoid and terpene profiles, to match users with products that have consistently helped others achieve similar goals. This method ensures that the recommendations are not influenced by marketing or brand reputation but are purely based on effectiveness as reported by a large and diverse group of users.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy leveraging this extensive and unbiased dataset, Jointly’s framework provides consumers with clear, data-backed product recommendations. This approach not only helps consumers make more informed decisions but also supports retailers in offering products that are more likely to satisfy their customers' specific needs. The result is a cannabis shopping experience that is both simpler and more reliable, leading to better outcomes for everyone involved.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow This Works In Practice \r\n\r\n\r\nStep 1\r\nSome variation of:\r\n“Why do you want to use cannabis?”\r\n“Why are you shopping for cannabis today?”\r\n“What’s your goal?” \r\n“What kind of experience are you after?”\r\n“How do you want to feel?”\r\n\r\nStep 2\r\nSome variation of:\r\n“Here are the products most likely to deliver for you - based on nothing other than the unique, organic, unbiased experiences of (lots of) other people with the same goal.” \r\n\r\n\r\nStep 3\r\nSome variation of:\r\n“Now let’s discuss and examine your preferences on the secondary product attributes to reach a final decision.”\r\n\r\nJointly brings data from over half a million documented consumer experiences and puts it in the hands of buyers and sellers of cannabis. This approach creates better experiences for all involved. \r\n\r\n\r\nFor the first time, people can choose their next cannabis purchase using data about what works best and sell cannabis using the same reliable information. This data is unbiased, organic, and authentic, free from outside influence.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Icing on the Cake\r\n\r\n\r\nThe cannabis journey, of course, doesn’t end with product selection, Cannabis affects each person uniquely due to factors like genetics, tolerance, and environment.\r\n\r\nWith at least 12 reasons to buy and various overlapping or opposing factors, consumers need a comprehensive approach. Jointly’s free mobile app helps consumers find success by demonstrating what it means to practice purposeful consumption. Purposeful consumption means consuming with intent, being mindful of the factors that can contribute to a better or worse experience, noting and addressing any side effects, and reflecting on how well it’s all working. Users of our app leverage their own data and the collective experiences of others to improve their own experiences. \r\n\r\n\r\nEach consumer’s experiences shared in Jointly also enhance the platform’s overall intelligence. That’s why it’s called Jointly. It’s an adverb. We all share our experiences. We all benefit. We cooperate and contribute jointly, and the best weed wins.",

    "content": "﻿Writing Style Analysis of David Kooi\r\n1. Purpose-Driven & Mission-Focused: Your writing is anchored in the goal of changing the conversation around cannabis, pushing for a shift toward “Purposeful Cannabis Consumption.” Each piece feels like a call to action, structured to dismantle misconceptions and reinforce the wellness potential of cannabis through data and personal experience. You regularly challenge outdated stigmas and advocate for a paradigm shift using persuasive, often philosophical language.\r\n2. Conversational Yet Structured: You blend conversational elements with structured argumentation, speaking directly to readers as if in a personal dialogue. This approach—marked by direct addresses, rhetorical questions, and informal segues—brings readers into your thought process, creating a sense of intimacy. Yet, there is a disciplined structure underlying the narrative, often organized around hypotheses, data, and logically connected points that build toward a clear, conclusive takeaway.\r\n3. Data-Driven & Analytical: Facts, data points, and methodical reasoning are hallmarks. You introduce concepts with analytical frameworks, such as “You + Cannabis > You,” turning abstract ideas into concrete, often mathematical expressions. Your use of data—especially Jointly’s proprietary findings—is integrated to substantiate the narrative, showing a commitment to elevating cannabis discourse with hard evidence.\r\n4. Poetic & Reflective Language: There’s a notable use of poetic phrasing and rhythmic sentences, especially when describing the personal and transformative experiences cannabis has provided. Phrases like “the joy of discovery” and “embrace the complexity of your experience” capture a reflective, sometimes metaphysical quality, presenting cannabis as a tool for self-connection, joy, and exploration. Even when reflecting on statistics, you maintain an element of wonder and curiosity.\r\n5. Authentic & Open-Ended: Your tone is humble, candid, and open about the evolving journey with cannabis and mental health. You often share personal stories of struggle and growth, revealing vulnerabilities to make readers feel seen and understood. This transparency establishes trust, with an openness to multiple paths and perspectives, emphasizing that cannabis use is deeply personal.\r\n6. Encouraging & Inclusive: The language is often inclusive and supportive, speaking to readers as peers on a shared journey. You avoid “prescriptive” language, preferring suggestions and reflections to rigid advice. You often reinforce that cannabis is not a cure-all, respecting the reader's autonomy while encouraging experimentation and self-discovery.\r\n7. Philosophical Depth: Finally, there’s a philosophical underpinning to much of your work, delving into existential themes like self-discovery, joy, and mental clarity. You often treat cannabis as a lens through which to explore life’s deeper meanings, using reflective questions and thoughtful asides to invite readers to ponder these broader questions.",
